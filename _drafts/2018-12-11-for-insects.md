When thinking about computer platforms, I often think of Robert Heinlein's oft-shared "specialization is for insects" quote from *Time Enough for Love*:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

The way this comes up is for examples, here's why I can't switch to Linux right now. Linux is a tremendous programming platform right now, that's important for me because programming is the number one activity I use computers for, and in general I'm generally attracted to the ethos 

But there's a really simple reason 

truth be told, in my world macOS doesn't have any competition

There's nothing else that is even on the same plane of existence for providing

This is also a great prism for analyzing the current status of iOS.


The only thing 

Make list of the major computer tasks

3D Rendering *probably macOS*
Animation *probably macOS*
**Design** *macOS*
Game Programming *probably macOS*
Illustration *perhaps iOS*
Movie Editing *probably macOS*
**Music Production** *macOS*
Photo Editing *Debatable*
**Programming** *macOS*
Prototyping *probably macOS*
Spreadsheets *probably macOS*
**Writing** *Debatable*

For me, this is my frustration with iOS, for almost everything I want to do it is worse.

The only task I've found it acceptable for is writing, for the others it's just dreadful, *dreadful*.

The only task that iOS could arguably the best at is the only item on this with an order of magnitude simpler software requirement. Lending the question of whether, the general point is iOS is a *less capable* operating system, due to its

If you want to have impact it this world, you have to use capable tools. From my perspective it seems you can get away with focusing on iOS 

One way to look at this is that iOS is a great platform if the impact you want to have on this world is mainly in the realms of photo editing, illustration, and writing.

But another way to look at this is that you have one extraordinarily flexible and powerful platform and another that's the opposite. Notably, if you choose to focus on macOS you will not be limited in any of these other categories.
