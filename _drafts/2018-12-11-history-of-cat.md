title: "How Little Actually Changes"
categories:

Sinclair Target at Two-Bit History has a [nice piece on `cat`](https://twobithistory.org/2018/11/12/cat.html), I liked this part about the contradictions in tech being called a fast-paced industry:

> It is easy to see why the average person might believe that a field like computer science, or a profession like software engineering, completely reinvents itself every few years. We had personal computers, then the web, then phones, then machine learning… technology is always changing, so surely all the underlying principles and techniques change too. Of course, the amazing thing is how little actually changes. Most people, I’m sure, would be stunned to know just how old some of the important software on their computer really is. I’m not talking about flashy application software, admittedly—my copy of Firefox, the program I probably use the most on my computer, is not even two weeks old. But, if you pull up the manual page for something like grep, you will see that it has not been updated since 2010 (at least on MacOS). And the original version of grep was written in 1974, which in the computing world was back when dinosaurs roamed Silicon Valley. People (and programs) still depend on grep every day.

This has some nice examples of things that move fast (devices) versus things that move slow (tools) in tech.
