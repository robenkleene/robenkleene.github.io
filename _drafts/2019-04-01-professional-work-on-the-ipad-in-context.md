In an [excellent video by Jonathan Morrison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItCj676GmA&list=PLqcaiHQwxA9jB-o-1-zmujxnbpaqwl9lV), professional hip hop producer Justin "Henny" Henderson, of [Tha Bizness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tha_Bizness), discusses how he work exclusively on an iPad . While I appreciate what this video for what it is, it's important to remember a single data point like this isn't useful in predicting the direction of an industry.

Lets contrast this to what a transition like this looks like in another industry. The [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)) text editor was first released in 2014, and [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) was released soon after in 2015. Both offered similar benefits over their predecessors including a best-in-class plugin ecosystems, an advantage complemented by both being open source and built on web technologies.

Using [Stackoverflow's Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com) data, here's how their market share growth has looked since their release:

1. [2015](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-editor): 2.8% combined, 2.8% Atom
2. [2016](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-development-environments): 19.7% combined, 12.5% Atom, 7.2% Visual Studio Code
3. [2017]([Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-_-most-popular-developer-environments-by-occupation)): 39.6% combined, 17.3% Atom, 22.3% Visual Studio Code
4. [2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments): 52.9% combined, 18% Atom, 34.9% Visual Studio Code

That's 52.9% of the market captured four years after the new products was introduced. 

We don't have any real numbers about iPad market share[^survey], but I think we can be certain the numbers look nothing like this.

There are all sorts of reasons the audio engineering industry is different than the programming industry. The programming industry is of course known for moving quickly. But the software Henny is using in the video, [BeatMaker](), was first released in 2008. At what point do we call a dud a dud?
