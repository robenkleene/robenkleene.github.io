On [Episode 105 of AppStories](https://appstories.net/episodes/105/), [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) and [John Voorhees](https://twitter.com/johnvoorhees) of [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) discuss Pro apps on the iPad.

One minor annoyance: In the podcast John describes [Ferrite Recording Studio](https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/) by Wooji Juice as like "Logic Pro on the Mac for Podcasts".

Comparing Ferrite to Logic Pro X needs a stronger caveat than that. Logic's manual is over 1000 pages, and that's only for the main app, if you also include the instruments and effects (which you should), that's over 2000 pages. Don't get me wrong, Ferrite is a *wonderful* app, but it's not like Logic.
