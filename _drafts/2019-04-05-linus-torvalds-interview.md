> Well, the traditional PC is obviously no longer quite the dominant
thing it used to be. Even when you have one (and even when it's still
running Windows or OS X), lots of people mainly interact with it
through a web browser and a couple random apps. Of course, then
there are the "workstation" users, which is kind of the desktop I was
personally always envisioning. And while still important, it doesn't
seem to drive the market the way the PC did back when. Powerful
desktop machines seem to be mostly about development or gaming, or
media editing. The "casual" desktop seems to have become more of a
browser thing, and quite often it's just a tablet or a phone.

Spot on.
