I [love](/2019/04/01/professional-work-on-the-ipad-in-context/) [discussing](/2019/04/02/sketch-figmas-market-share/) market share numbers for professional tools[^photoshop], so I was happy to find this breakdown on [video editor market share](http://www.learningvideo.com/nle-market-share-breakdown/) [Dave Dugdale](https://twitter.com/dugdale) conducted by polling his audience ("over 1000 people responded"):

1. 63% Adobe Premiere Pro
2. 20% Final Cut Pro[^finalcut]
3. 14% Sony Vegas Pro
4. 3% Avid Media Composer

[^photoshop]: Before switching over to programming, I spent many years as a designer. One of the reasons I care so much about the future of pro apps is I realized as a designer so much of what I was learning was all just muscle memory for using Photoshop efficiently. Since these apps are so large and complex, they require tremendous investment from the user, therefore the software publishers have a responsibility to manage them appropriately.

[^finalcut]: This poll was conducted in 2014, so that's *after* [the contentious release of Final Cut Pro X Backlash](https://daringfireball.net/2011/06/final_cut_pro_x_backlash)
