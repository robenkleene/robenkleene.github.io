[Jonathan Morrison](https://twitter.com/tldtoday), whose video with hip hop producer Justin “Henny” Henderson's [iPad-only workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItCj676GmA&list=PLqcaiHQwxA9jB-o-1-zmujxnbpaqwl9lV) I linked to previously, has a couple of other videos about pro iPad usage that are worth watching:

1. In a follow-up music production video, [Henderson sits with Grammy-winning engineer Ken Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxvliLODkxI) and guides him as he tries working on an iPad.
2. [Jonathan himself edits an entire video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo) on an iPad Pro using [LumaFusion](https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios/).

As [I noted previously](/2019/04/01/professional-work-on-the-ipad-in-context/), when looking at the direction that a market is going, the best indicator is market-share numbers rather than individual workflows. But that doesn't mean these aren't great videos to watch for anyone interested iPads and the future direction of professional software.
