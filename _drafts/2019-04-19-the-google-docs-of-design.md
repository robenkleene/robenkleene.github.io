Inc.'s 30 Under 30 has a feature by Michelle Cheng on Figma design's founders called ["Figma Wants to Be the Google Docs of Digital Design"](https://www.inc.com/michelle-cheng/figma-design-cloud-collaboration-google-docs-30-under-30-2019.html?utm_content=buffer45db6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). I'm not sure people realize how big a deal Figma is; Figma could be the tipping point that ends native desktop apps for creative professionals. Figma is a web-based design tool, and [according to Uxtools.co's data](/2019/04/02/sketch-figmas-market-share/) it's the second most popular design tool after the fully-native (and Mac-only) [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/).

The title "the Google Docs of Digital Design", captures the impact of the idea. The Google Docs approach, having a single document that anyone can view and edit at anytime, has huge benefits.

But design is different than an office suite. Google Docs is "zero-skill" software. Almost everyone can use Google Docs without training, and almost no one spends their whole day in it, it's usually one of many tools used lightly through out the day. Design is the opposite, it's highly-skilled work, not just in having design expertise, but just using the tool itself requires expertise, and the people who do it, usually spend their whole day in their design tool of choice. This is a perfect match for the advantages of native apps: Native apps can be more responsive by being implemented closer to the hardware, and quality distinctions, like an being more Mac-like, are more important when you're spending all-day in a tool.

But the elephant in the room for design is version control. Design is still stuck in the dark ages of document management[^cloudfoldersync], with lots of different similar filenames floating around in email with different version numbers appended to the filename[^versioncontrolpodcast]. I don't see how that's a solvable problem without moving to a tool that's web-based, where a central repository is always the source of truth[^nativeandsync]. And if that's true for design why isn't it also true for video editing, 3D modeling, animation, music editing, or any of the other creative work that's still dominated by native apps today?

[^versioncontrolpodcast]: [Paul Ford](https://twitter.com/ftrain) and [Rich Ziade](https://twitter.com/richziade) have [a great discussion about version control and document management](https://postlight.com/trackchanges/podcast/version-control-is-there-a-better-way-to-manage-change) on the Track Changes podcast.

[^enthusiasts]: Just to be clear there will always be a market for enthusiasts, that's not going anywhere. But right now native apps are the most popular for all creative professional work.

[^cloudfoldersync]: Cloud sync services like Dropbox have helped, but not alleviated, the problem.

[^nativeandsync]: The technical overhead of doing editing in a native app locally and automatically syncing changes is just not worth it.
