[Brent Simmons](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons/) has [a great piece on the loss of freedom and power](http://inessential.com/2019/04/23/freedom) that a lot of us old-time Mac users find so unsettling about Apple's current direction:

> Meanwhile, the iOS triumphalists are saying that we should welcome the end of the revolution.

> People will probably tell me it’s generational. And maybe it is. But if we don’t have this power that is ours, then I don’t actually care about computers at all. It meant everything.
