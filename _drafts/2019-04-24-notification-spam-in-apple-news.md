It isn't that bad for me, but I also get push notifications for articles and human interest stories where it isn't appropriate. I appreciate what Apple is trying to do with the News app, but I don't think it's there yet. Here's my personal list of issues:

1. The information hierarchy is not there, the most important story should take up the most space and be in the upper left. After reading the "Today" section in Apple News, I don't feel like I understand what the most important stories of the day are.
2. There are too many opinion articles. I don't read opinion articles, I appreciate that some people do, but opinion articles should be separate from news, ideally in there own section.
3. The aforementioned issue with push notifications.

I worked on the Wall Street Journal's iOS app for five years, and that publication performs swimmingly in all of these categories. I particularly want to call out their push notifications, which are impeccable.
