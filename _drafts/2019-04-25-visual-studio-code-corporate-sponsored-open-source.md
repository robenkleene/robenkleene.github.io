On [The Changelog episode #277 about Visual Studio Code](https://changelog.com/podcast/277) [Chris Dias](https://twitter.com/chrisdias), from the Visual Studio Code team, says that there are 20-25 people working on the product. He doesn't specify the roles of all those people (or say if they're working on it full time) but it puts [the success of Visual Studio Code](/2019/04/10/2019-stackoverflow-developer-survey-results/) into perspective. For comparison, [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are both mainly developed by one person. What do you do when one of the biggest companies in the world starts giving away your product for free?

I call the model used by [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) (and [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor))) "corporate-sponsored open source" in order to differentiate it from the community-driven open source of [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) and [Neovim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). Corporate-sponsored open source isn't new, it's been particularly popular with frameworks for a long time[^corporatesponsoredopensourceframeworks], but its influence on desktop apps is relatively new[^corporatesponsoredopensourcedesktop].

The business strategy for frameworks is more straightforward, and therefore less problematic. The frameworks are usually used to build other products inside the company that are presumably directly tied to revenue.

But with the desktop apps, it's hard to discern exactly how they fit into a revenue strategy, which is concerning. On the one hand, there's the stability question: How long will it be sustainable to invest this many resources into a product that doesn't directly result in revenue? Whereas on the other hand, if the product does actually fit into the company's business model, if you're not paying for it, than [it's probably not going to be in way that you like](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/976473447374221313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

[^corporatesponsoredopensourceframeworks]: [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)), [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) are all framework examples of corporate-sponsored open source.

[^corporatesponsoredopensourcedesktop]: The main examples of desktop corporate-sponsored open source are Visual Studio Code and Atom, but you could also somewhat include [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) and [Chromium]([Chromium - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium)).
