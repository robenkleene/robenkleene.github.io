Frederic Lardinois [writing for TechCrunch about a new terminal emulator for Windows](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/windows-gets-a-new-terminal/) launching in June:

> The new terminal will feature faster GPU-accelerated text rending and “emoji-rich” fonts, because everything these days needs to support emojis, and those will sure help lighten up the command-line user experience. More importantly, though, the Windows Terminal will also support shortcuts, tabs, tear-away windows and theming, as well as extensions. It also will natively support Unicode and East Asian fonts.

Microsoft is really firing on all cylinders. It's also interesting to see that that it's GPU accelerated. My first encounter with a GPU-accelerated terminal was with the open-source [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty), my understanding is that this makes dumps of large amounts of text go smoother. Microsoft shipping this feature is probably the first time it's gone mainstream.
