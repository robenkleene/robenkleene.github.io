Great [in-depth study of a prototype iPad app](https://www.inkandswitch.com/muse-studio-for-ideas.html) they've developed at Ink & Switch:

> Muse is a prototype iPad app for reading, thinking, and developing your ideas. Starting with inspiration from physical workspaces, it tries to be a repository for your creative inputs; helps you see and connect all your raw material to make new creative leaps; and enables active reading of PDFs and other media via annotations and excerpting. All of this is in a fast, fluid user interface to create a sense of empowerment and excitement for you as a creative person.

The app is an example of a [zooming user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface). One of the most exciting aspects of the mobile era is how it has lead us to re-evaluate so many paradigms we've taken for granted in computing, starting with the [WIMP user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)). While some of these changes have been successful, like the "app-centric" nature of iOS[^appcentricos], what has been more remarkable to me is just how resilient most of paradigms have turned out to be.

At the heart of many of the debates currently raging over the pros and cons of iOS vs. macOS paradigms, open vs. closed, file-centric vs. app-centric OS, and [tiling window ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) vs. traditional [windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)) management, is a deeper question: Why did we arrive at our current paradigms? Was it and accident of history? Or did they win in the marketplace of ideas because they are fundamentally better?

The important thing to recognize is the ideas most definitely *aren't new*. The zooming user interface was first tried in 1962[^firstzui], and both the Xerox Star from 1981[^twmxeroxstar], and the first version of Microsoft Windows[^mswtwm] used tiling window managers.

If you're advocating that the iOS way of doing things is better, it's important to ask some questions. Why did this paradigm fail in the first place? Why did we end up choosing the paradigm we have now? And what's changed that makes this paradigm better now?

[^appcentricos]: When your iPhone finishes starting up, you [SpringBoard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringBoard), your apps, whereas when you startup a Mac you see your [desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor), your files. That's the fundamental difference of the app-centric OS.

[^firstzui]: [Wikipedia on the first ZUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface#History): "Ivan Sutherland presented the first program for zooming through and creating graphical structures with constraints and instancing, on a CRT in his Sketchpad program in 1962."

[^twmxeroxstar]: [Wikipedia on the Xerox Star's TWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#Xerox_PARC): "The first Xerox Star system (released in 1981) tiled application windows, but allowed dialogs and property windows to overlap."

[^mswtwm]: [Wikipedia on the TWM in Microsoft Windows 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#History_2): "The first version (Windows 1.0) featured a tiling window manager, partly because of litigation by Apple claiming ownership of the overlapping window desktop metaphor. But due to complaints, the next version (Windows 2.0) followed the desktop metaphor. All later versions of the operating system stuck to this approach as the default behaviour."
