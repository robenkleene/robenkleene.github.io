[Huge update to the fantastic macOS and iOS writing app Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/blog/2019/05/ulysses-16/), new features include a split view on iPad to view two documents side-by-side. Here's the list of ways to trigger the second view:

> 1. Drag a sheet from the sheet list to either edge of the screen — this will trigger a nice animation and then open the dragged sheet next to the current view.
> 2. Activate “Second Editor” from the editor settings. This will open the current sheet next to the current view.
> 3. Tap and hold the Export button in the editor. A menu will pop up and offer “Export in Second Editor”.
> 4. With an external keyboard attached, you can either hit command-option-3 (⌘⌥3) to open the current sheet in editor mode, or hit command-option-6 (⌘⌥6), to open the export preview of the current sheet.

The choice of the keyboard shortcut `⌘⌥3` is interesting, this is based on the keyboard shortcut `⌘3` to switch to the editor view. I don't see a keyboard shortcut to switch *focus* between the two views.

I'm struck how, much like the [built-in iOS multi-tasking features](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207582), none of these ways of triggering a second view feel like first-class citizens. Contrast this with macOS where keyboard shortcuts like `⌘T` or `⌘N`, or just double-clicking a file, are all first-class citizens. When I think about what makes working on iOS feel so much slower than macOS, the number one difference is the lack of first-class multitasking support on iOS.
