Steve Troughton-Smith [tweeted demoing mouse support](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1135653636145590273) in iOS 13, a new accessibility feature. He later [followed up](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1135868173427908610): "I think this is my most popular tweet — ever. Apple, if you think you’re gonna get away with hiding iPad mouse support in AssistiveTouch and only half-supporting it, you’re kidding yourselves".

I'm looking forward to hearing what people who have gone all-in on the iPad, like [Ben Brooks](https://brooksreview.net/), [Matt Gemmell](https://mattgemmell.com/blog/), and [Federico Viticci](https://www.macstories.net/), think of mouse support. The hypothesis espoused here is that a mouse will be a better input method for many ways of working, because [innovation is easier than we think](/2019/04/11/a-few-smart-people-in-a-room/). If touch were a good way of working when you're at a desk, then we would have had it decades ago.
