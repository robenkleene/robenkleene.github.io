Steve Troughton-Smith [tweets](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1135780593541799936) that it's faster to connect to VNC on macOS Catalina. I'm [hoping](https://twitter.com/robenkleene/status/1131984224653860869) Apple is working on a remote development environment for iOS, and this is the type of change you'd see if that were the case. A remote development environment would mean you could use iOS hardware with macOS software: You could travel with an external keyboard and mouse that you'd only need to connect when you need to use macOS. This is the only way I could see myself switching entirely to iOS hardware as long as [rule 2.5.2](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#2.5.2) exists.
