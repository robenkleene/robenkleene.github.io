In a [toot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)), [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/) [summarizes the differences between open source licenses](https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102198913104727192):

> MIT, BSD: Do whatever you want with this software, but it's not our responsibility (baseline)

> Apache: Same but with extra protections for your trademarks/brand

> GPL: Requires derivative software and software to also use the GPL license

> LGPL: Requires derivatives to also use the LGPL license, but doesn't consider linking to a library to be a derivative

> AGPL: Requires derivatives to also use the AGPL license, but considers communication over the network to be derivative
