[Soulver 3 has been released for macOS](https://documentation.soulver.app/whats-new). One of the most useful apps on the platform. New features include [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/dark-mode/), and an integrated document manager (like Apple's [Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) app).
