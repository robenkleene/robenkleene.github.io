[Matt Birchler](https://twitter.com/mattbirchler) [measures how long it takes various text editors](https://birchtree.me/blog/how-long-to-the-major-macos-text-editors-take-to-open-huge-files/) to open a 1.5GB CSV file. [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is the fastest, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) also fair pretty well. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is the slowest.
