A long journey [begins a new chapter](https://inessential.com/2019/08/26/netnewswire_5_0_now_available). After [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com/) launched [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) in 2002, it was then sold to [NewsGator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitrion) in 2005, acquired by [Black Pixel](https://blackpixel.com/) in 2011, and returned to Brent Simmons in 2018. Quite a journey for an app to make, especially an indie app.

For an indie app to have this kind of journey it has to be something special, which NetNewsWire most definitely is. Many of us consider it the defining app from the golden age of Cocoa app development.
