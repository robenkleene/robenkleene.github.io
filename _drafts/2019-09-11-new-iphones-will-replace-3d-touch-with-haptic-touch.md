title: "New iPhones Will Replace 3D Touch With Haptic Touch"

Juli Clover [reports for MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/10/iphone-11-no-3d-touch/) that 3D Touch has been removed from the new iPhones, replaced with Haptic Touch.

This strikes me as a mistake. 3D Touch is a power user feature: It's not discoverable, and it often lets you do things faster than the conventional route. iOS needs more, not less, power users features, the platform already buckles under even remotely complicated tasks ("select all" in a list anyone?).

My guess is this is a symptom of a larger problem: Apple is increasingly making decisions based on usage analytics. In other words, less popular features get cut. The problem with basing these decisions on the popularity is that *not all users are equally valuable*. Power users are more valuable by an order of magnitude. They're the ones [building websites](https://www.macstories.net/) to evangelize your platform, and even more importantly *building the content for your platform*. The measure of a platform is not how popular the features are, *it's what the most capable users of your platform can accomplish*.
