[John Gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber) [offers compelling evidence at Daring Fireballe](https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/on_the_rankings_of_apples_own_apps_in_app_store_results) that the artificial boost Apple's apps were getting in App Store search, as [reported in The New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html) that [I linked to last week](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/09/10/apple-boosting-their-own-apps-in-app-store-search/), is more likely the result of a lousy search algorithm than a deliberate attempt to promote their own apps. Hilariously, this ends up driving home the overarching point even more: If you don't allow competition then you get bad products. App Store search is terrible because no other company besides Apple is allowed to do it.
