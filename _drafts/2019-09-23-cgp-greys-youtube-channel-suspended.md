Popular [YouTuber CGP Grey's](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) Google account has been [suspended](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/status/1175681091165966336). His videos are still up, but he cannot login to his Google account to manage them or upload more. This is a chilling reminder that when your business is built on someone else's platform, the rug can be pulled out from under you at any moment. If your business is in content creation, the unfortunate reality is that [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) can't be ignored, and that means building at least some of your business on someone else's platform. The key is understanding that this is a necessary evil and designing your business around mediating its impact. It's necessary to share your content on a platform, if that's where the audience is, but you should also always have your own URL where people can find all of your content and follow you.
