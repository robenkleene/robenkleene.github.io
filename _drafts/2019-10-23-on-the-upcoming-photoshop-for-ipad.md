Photoshop for iPad is [still slated for release this year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/adobe-photoshop-is-coming-to-apple-s-ipad-in-mobile-app-push), and news is leaking that it [may not be quite up to expectations](https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1186410555566936064)

We're watching history in the making here, and not just because of Photoshop, but generally the question of what's the best way to do a multi-device app is far from answered. Most people seem to think the answer is obvious: That the best way to do cross-device apps is for them to have feature parity from the beginning. But I think that's wrong, because you can't do feature parity without conforming to the limitations of your least capable platform, and if you do that, then you lose the most capable platform, the desktop, which, not coincidentally, is *by far* the most important market for powerful apps like Photoshop.

We can see these priorities play out by looking at the market performance of the apps that *have* taken the feature-parity approach: [Apple's iWork](https://www.apple.com/iwork/) suite and [Serif's Affinity products](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/). Those apps don't have enough users to even be discussed in [office suite](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2019/) and [creative app](https://uxtools.co/survey-2018/) market-share surveys. Contrast this with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), whose growth is taking off in the same creative-app market-share survey. It's browser first and has no mobile app, instead it focuses on solving a problem that's more important to creative professionals: Keeping the work of many different product designers in sync. It's worth re-iterating [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) are four and five years old respectively, by comparison [Adobe InDesign was finishing its victory lap around QuarkXPress](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/quarkxpress-the-demise-of-a-design-desk-darling/) when it was just five years old.

The question of what's the best way to do cross-device apps is still far from answered, the release of a major app like Photoshop for iPad will help shed some new light on the subject.
