title: "Ploopy: An Open Source Trackball"

[Ploopy](https://www.ploopy.co/) is an open source trackball based on the venerable [Microsoft Trackball Explorer](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-D68-00007-Trackball-Explorer/dp/B00005853Z)---which is no longer in production but is popular enough that its resale price has skyrocketed. Ploopy is available to [pre-order in kit form](https://www.ploopy.co/s/shop). Today I prefer trackpads, because the [gestures for accessing Mission Control and App Expos√© on macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204895) are too good to pass up, but before that I always preferred trackballs to mice. I went from the Microsoft Trackball Explorer itself through [every generation of the Kensington Expert Mouse](http://xahlee.info/kbd/kensington_expert_mouse_hist.html), the most recent of which is [still available new today](https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Expert-Trackball-Mouse-K64325/dp/B00009KH63/).

I also use an [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard and part of the appeal is the open source hardware. I'm hoping to be able to use this keyboard design for the rest of my career. I'm not sure the [open source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware) model works as well for pointing device as it does for a keyboard. One of the reasons it works so well for keyboards is that the foundational technology has changed to little over the years. [Cherry MX](https://www.cherrymx.de) switches were [developed in the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_\(keyboards\)#Cherry_MX_switches_in_consumer_keyboards) and, as far as I can tell, they're very similar to the product that's the industry standard for keyboard switches today. With pointing devices on the other hand, there have been a couple of major upheavals like the [optical mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse) and [touchpads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad) themselves.
