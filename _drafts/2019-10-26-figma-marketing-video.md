[Figma has a new market video](https://vimeo.com/366560857) that does a great job illustrating the advantages of their app. I've been bringing up Figma [a lot](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/10/23/on-the-upcoming-photoshop-for-ipad/) [recently](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/10/24/web-development-on-an-ipad/), and that's because watching how it plays out feels like watching the future of the entire desktop software industry.

Think of it this way: What other app categories can benefit from the features described in the video? We already know those features are compelling for an [office suite](https://docs.google.com), but what about a video editor like [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)? A 3D modeling environment like [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/)? A gaming engine like [Unity](https://unity.com/)? The entire [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)?

It starts to seem like those features are compelling for almost every type of application out there. And if that's true, it's just a matter of time until all of those tools get replaced by a web-based version.
