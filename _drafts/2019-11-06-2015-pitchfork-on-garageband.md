[Art Tavana](https://www.arttavana.com/) [piece on GarageBand for Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9728-democracy-of-sound-is-garageband-good-for-music/). Grimes' first album, [Visions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visions_(Grimes_album)), was made using the software (she's since switched to [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/)):

> Take Claire Boucher, aka Grimes, who spent years tooling around with GarageBand in Montreal's underground scene while searching for her voice as an artist and producer. Those experiments eventually led to the 27-year-old's breakthrough album, Visions, which was recorded entirely on the digital audio workstation, or DAW. Eventually, though, she realized the software's limitations couldn't keep up with her appetite for digital complexity. "It really can't do anything," Boucher once told Clash magazine. "There's not a lot of stuff in GarageBand that's good." Boucher has since graduated to more advanced DAWs like Ableton Live.

There's a general feeling that GarageBand 10 is too limiting:

> But, according to several musicians, newer versions of GarageBand make it harder to innovate and customize, showing that there's a fine line between a program that's accessible and one that's too accessible. "You feel like you're being told what to do now," says Harvey. "So I just use an old version because I like the control it gives me." In general, advanced users of GarageBand prefer the version of the software they first recorded on, suggesting that these digital natives aren't above the comforts of nostalgia and familiarity.

GarageBand is an interesting prism to look at Apple because it's the only creative tool that Apple makes for iOS[^applecreativeapps]. Personally, I find GarageBand so limiting it gives the impression of being hostile to the very act of creativity. It has wonderful built-in drum kits and various ways to play them, but you can't create your own drum kits made up of your own sounds. Presumably there's a historical precedent for that, but I've never come across that. GarageBand's drum kits are essentially a drum [sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)), where you can only use sounds provided by Apple. [GarageBand for iOS 2.2](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/garageband-and-logic-pro-x-music-apps-get-major-updates/) added a powerful new synthesizer called Alchemy that they had acquired in 2015 from [Camel Audio](https://9to5mac.com/2015/02/23/apple-camel/). But the version of Alchemy in GarageBand has a new minimal interface that hides most of its controls:

Here's what Alchemy's interface looks like in [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) (this is the "Advanced" view, the minimal interface GarageBand uses also available under "Simple"):

There's a difference between believing tools can be simplified, and being hostile to the very idea of expertise and open-ended creativity. Apple is increasingly veering towards the latter. This is the Apple that's simultaneously [marketing the iPad as a computer replacement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZys3xg6sU) and selling [$10,000 computers to creative professionals](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/). Creative professionals have always needed expensive computers, but other than being more powerful, they used to be the same computers that the rest of us used. We could use and learn the same tools that the pros use, just on a smaller scale. But with tools like GarageBand, you can't learn how to program drums with your own sounds, or design your own sounds with a synthesizer. This is working to undo 35 years of democratization of creative tools brought on by the [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), returning us to a world where creativity is reserved for the professionals that have access to the expensive tools required to do it.

[^applecreativeapps]: The other example is [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/), but that's marketed more as a way to creative something from your home movies, rather than as a creative tool.
