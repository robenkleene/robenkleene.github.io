It's been a big week for Photoshop, [Photoshop for iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop/id1457771281) is out, and on the desktop [Photoshop 2020](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) has been released. The desktop app icon has been updated to use the rounded-corner icon style used by [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), here's the new Photoshop icon:

And here's the [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) icon that still uses the old style with sharp corners:

So far it seems like the new icon style is being used to designate products that are cross-device? [Dimension](https://www.adobe.com/products/dimension.html), [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [Premiere Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html), and Photoshop are the ones that use it now, and of those only Dimension isn't cross-device yet.

[Julianne Kost](https://twitter.com/julieannekost) from Adobe [summarizes what's new](http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/2019/11/adobe-announces-updates-and-new-features-for-photoshop.html) in Photoshop 2020. This caught my eye:

> 1) Consistent Free Transform – When in free transform, clicking the link icon (in the Options bar) will toggle the  “constrain aspect ratio” option on/off . The state of the icon is sticky – once it’s set, it will stay that way until it’s clicked again. This means that, regardless of the contents of the layer (pixels, type, shape, etc.), transform will behave consistently. Holding the Shift key while transforming will temporarily toggle the opposite behavior.

Before switching back to app development in 2011, I worked as a user-interface designer for eight years. I practically lived in Photoshop during that time. I was so frustrated with Adobe for not creating an app like [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)[^missingtheboatonsketch] that I swore off their products for years and did all of design and image editing in Sketch and the wonderful [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). Recently, I decided to back to Adobe's products when I did my overview of [creative apps on Apple's platforms](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/08/07/apples-app-stores-have-failed-creative-apps/) and realized that, while Adobe had missed the boat on Sketch, the companies product line was actually quite healthy otherwise (to say the least).

So I've been using Photoshop again, and for the most part the application feels similar[^photoshopslowdialogs] to when I left it. But the one things that's been driving me crazy is the inverted default behavior for free transform, you used to hold shift to constrain proportions, but now it constrains proportions by default, and you hold shift *to turn off* constraining proportions. Apparently this changed was introduced in Photoshop CC 2019, and I'm not the only one it has been driving crazy. [Veerle Pieters](https://twitter.com/vpieters) shared how you could [revert to the legacy behavior by editing a text-based configuration file](https://veerle.duoh.com/design/get-back-to-the-legacy-transform-behavior-in-photoshop-cc2019). The new approach of providing a toggle setting to the toolbar, that remains sticky between launches, seems like a good compromise.

[^missingtheboatonsketch]: I'd contend that Adobe leaving the user-interface market open for a competitor like Sketch to emerge is the greatest blunder in creative apps I've seen in my 20 year career.
[^photoshopslowdialogs]: The file dialogs are also slow now...
