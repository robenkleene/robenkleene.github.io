[Alex Gollner](https://twitter.com/alex4d) on [what Apple needs to do to make the Mac Pro successful](https://medium.com/@alex4d/the-make-or-break-mac-pro-2019-feature-no-one-is-talking-about-ef8e52b9d6a8). He makes the prescient point that how Apple cultivates the ecosystem is more important than features:

> The feature that matters the most is Apple’s go-to-market strategy. How will 2019 Mac Pro hardware, software and services will be sold and supported? If they answer remains ‘Apple will do it,’ the new computer may have failed already.

> Up until 2010, there was a thriving third-party ecosystem to support professional Mac users. This ecosystem was made up of individuals and businesses who didn’t just ‘bet their business’ on professional Mac hardware and software but bet their business on those who themselves bet their businesses on the Mac.

One of the most frustrating things about modern Apple is that they won't let healthy businesses form around their products. 
Most of the apps on the iOS and Mac App Store seem to be supported by development teams that barely exist (outside of games, which appear to be a healthy thriving industry on both app stores). Modern Apple's [policies for their platforms](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/08/07/apples-app-stores-have-failed-creative-apps/) are preventing healthy businesses from forming. Why aren't companies like [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) ([over 21,000 employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.)), [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) ([almost 500 employees](https://craft.co/ableton), or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) forming in these ecosystems?

Sketch has been around for nine years and [their company page](https://www.sketch.com/about-us/) lists 71 employees. [Savage Interactive](http://savage.si/), the company behind [Procreate](https://procreate.art/), which was [overall bestselling iPad app in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procreate_(software)),[^procreateisgreatonipad] has been around for eight years and lists 17 people on their homepage. After that things drop off of a precipice. The popular video editing app [LumaFusion](https://luma-touch.com/) [lists eight](https://luma-touch.com/us/)[^macindycompanysizes]. For me personally, two of the apps I use to make iOS useful, [WorkingCopy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) and [Secure ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app/) (a git client and ftp client respectively) are [maintained by one person](https://twitter.com/palmin).

It's not enough just to make great products, you have to also need a great ecosystem. The Mac has great ecosystem of healthy business *outside* of the Mac App Store. The iOS app store, while a popular place to publish apps for companies who have a main business elsewhere, a tiny group of small companies, and a ton of game developers, it's just not a good place to build your software business. And, by extension, that means it's not a good place for users to invest their time and energy, at least in learning the types of complex, powerful apps needed to do creative work, because the software you depend on [often disappears overnight](https://panic.com/blog/the-future-of-transmit-ios/)[^whenitsgoodtouseiossoftware].

[^procreateisgreatonipad]: Procreate is also the creative app that is the best match for iOS's form factor.

[^macindycompanysizes]: As far as the Mac indy app companies, [OmniGroup's about page lists 42](https://www.omnigroup.com/) and [Rogue Amoeba's lists 10](https://rogueamoeba.com/company/).
