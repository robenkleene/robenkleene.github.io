[Ben Evans](https://twitter.com/benedictevans) of [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) [on the new wave of productivity startups](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/9/27/new-productivity):

> Part of the point of both of these waves of company creation is that merely taking Excel or Word or Powerpoint and putting them onto the web may make the file share thing work a bit more smoothly, but doesn’t actually create a new workflow.  If I’m a lawyer reviewing files for court, pasting the file names into a Google Sheet is probably better than pasting them into an Excel file on a network drive, but it’s still not as good as an actual tool. [...]

> If you want to book X, the old workflow is a spreadsheet or an old-world database, plus phone calls, faxes or email. And the way you solve this is not by moving it from Excel to Google sheets, any more than the way you solve version tracking of video edits or legal document review is to move it from Excel to Google sheets. You solve it with a dedicated workflow and tools. Honor is Figma for  home help - or vice versa. [...]

> Meanwhile, a few years ago a consultant told me that for half of their jobs they told people using Excel to use a database, and for the other half they told people using a database to use Excel. There’s clearly a point in the life of any company where you should move from the list you made in a spreadsheet to the richer tools you can make in coolproductivityapp.io. But when that tool is managing a thousand people, you might want to move it into a dedicated service. After all, even Craigslist started as an actual email list and ended up moving to a database. But then, at a certain point, if that task is specific to your company and central to what you do, you might well end up unbundling Salesforce or SAP or whatever that vertical is and go back to the beginning. 

The piece also references [an image](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) by [Andrew Parker](https://twitter.com/andrewparker/) that perhaps expresses the idea more concisely. As Evans describes it, "[by] showing how many startups were unbundling parts of Craigslist into dedicated vertical marketplaces". The point is that web apps and mobile apps are specialized when compared to desktop software, and the trend is increasing over time[^webandmobileappsareeasytoinstall].

I feel like an odd man out by advocating for powerful, flexible software. I'm usually talking about creative software, where power and flexibility are essential. You can normalize your business processes to use an off-the-shelf solution but if you do the same with creative software, you've removed the capacity for expression. But even for general purpose software, it feels it's odd that's it's the most technical people who are usually advocating for everyone to get off flexible, powerful tools for off-the-shelf specialized solutions.

To use [Siracusa's car analogy](https://hypercritical.co/2013/03/08/the-case-for-a-true-mac-pro-successor), the big applications, the [Photoshops](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/free-trial-download.html), the [Excels](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), seem like they're supercars of software, tools that shape themselves to the problem at hand. But the only powerful and flexible apps that tech community advocates for [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), which are all open source, but are also all tools *programmers themselves need*. For everyone else it's inflexible, specialized web apps, which are also almost always closed source, while [*also requiring users to hand over control of their data*](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/10/19/the-death-of-files/).

On one hand I suppose it makes sense, since it's programmers themselves that are creating these more specialized tools, but on the other hand, we're also supposed to be the people who actually like software. Yet here we are telling people to use [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) instead of [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), even though it's less powerful and [people like using it less](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/08/31/office-suite-market-share/).

I've always loved the chapter on tools from [*The Pragmatic Programmer*](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition), where [Dave Thomas](https://twitter.com/pragdave) and [Andy Hunt](https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy) advocate learning one text editor well and then using it for everything. The tech community does a good job following this advice well for the aforementioned tools, i.e., their own tools, but then promotes a different type of tool for everyone, and everything else. I think people would be better off investing in learning a few flexible and powerful[^personalvsbusinesssoftware] apps that they can use long-term, rather than constantly migrating their data and workflow from one specialized app to the next until the end of time.

[^webandmobileappsareeasytoinstall]: More specialized apps are partially being driven by the ease of installation (or lack thereof on the web) of mobile apps, which reduces the cost of having many apps when compared to the desktop.

[^personalvsbusinesssoftware]: The trade-offs or different between personal and business software. Off-the-shelf software is great for businesses, since there the priority is collaboration. You want everyone to be able to use the same tool with as little friction as possible. But trade-offs are different for individuals with their personal data. There I think the priority is still being able to open their files for decades to come.
