[Ben Evans](https://twitter.com/benedictevans) from [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) [on the new wave of productivity startups](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/9/27/new-productivity):

> Part of the point of both of these waves of company creation is that merely taking Excel or Word or Powerpoint and putting them onto the web may make the file share thing work a bit more smoothly, but doesn’t actually create a new workflow.  If I’m a lawyer reviewing files for court, pasting the file names into a Google Sheet is probably better than pasting them into an Excel file on a network drive, but it’s still not as good as an actual tool. [...]

> If you want to book X, the old workflow is a spreadsheet or an old-world database, plus phone calls, faxes or email. And the way you solve this is not by moving it from Excel to Google sheets, any more than the way you solve version tracking of video edits or legal document review is to move it from Excel to Google sheets. You solve it with a dedicated workflow and tools. Honor is Figma for  home help - or vice versa. [...]

> Meanwhile, a few years ago a consultant told me that for half of their jobs they told people using Excel to use a database, and for the other half they told people using a database to use Excel. There’s clearly a point in the life of any company where you should move from the list you made in a spreadsheet to the richer tools you can make in coolproductivityapp.io. But when that tool is managing a thousand people, you might want to move it into a dedicated service. After all, even Craigslist started as an actual email list and ended up moving to a database. But then, at a certain point, if that task is specific to your company and central to what you do, you might well end up unbundling Salesforce or SAP or whatever that vertical is and go back to the beginning. 

The piece references [an image](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) by [Andrew Parker](https://twitter.com/andrewparker/) expresses the idea concisely by "showing how many startups were unbundling parts of Craigslist into dedicated vertical marketplaces", web apps and mobile apps are increasing in specialization overtime, especially when compared to desktop software.

I increasingly feel like the odd man out promoting more powerful, flexible software. I partially do this because I talk about creative software, where power and flexibility are essential: With business processes, normalizing workflows in order to use an off-the-shelf solution is usually a cheaper and better way to solve your problem, but do the same with creative software and you've reduced the software's capacity for expression. But even more than that, I feel like it's odd that it's the technical people that advocate everyone get off the more flexible, powerful tools for off-the-shelf solutions. On one hand I guess it makes sense, since it's programmers that are building these more specialized tools, but on the other hand, we're also supposed to be the people who actually like software. Yet here we are telling people to use [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) instead of [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) [even though people like using it less](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/08/31/office-suite-market-share/).

I've always loved the chapter on tools from [*The Pragmatic Programmer*](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition), where [Dave Thomas](https://twitter.com/pragdave) and [Andy Hunt](https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy) advocate learning one text editor well and then using it for everything. And generally I think people would be better off if they invested in learning a few flexible and powerful[^personalvsbusinesssoftware] apps that they can use long-term, rather than constantly migrating their data and workflow from one specialized app to the next until the end of time.

[^webandmobileappsareeasytoinstall]: More specialized apps are partially being driven by the ease of installation (or lack thereof on the web) of mobile apps, which reduces the cost of having many apps when compared to the desktop.

[^personalvsbusinesssoftware]: The trade-offs or different between personal and business software. Off-the-shelf software is great for businesses, since there the priority is collaboration. You want everyone to be able to use the same tool with as little friction as possible. But trade-offs are different for individuals with their personal data. There I think the priority is still being able to open their files for decades to come.
