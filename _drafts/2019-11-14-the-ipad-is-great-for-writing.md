[Farhad Manjoo](https://twitter.com/fmanjoo) wrote an opinion column with the bold title ["Steve Jobs Was Right: Smartphones and Tablets Killed the P.C."](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/opinion/apple-macbook-pro-ipad.html). With a title like that, I was expecting some evidence of shifting behaviors among a broad spectrum of consumers towards iPads at the expense of Macs, but the content of the piece is actually that Manjoo himself prefers working on an iPad:

> Ultimately, it’s the ecosystem that explains why I can’t stop raving about the iPad. When it came out, the big knock on the iPad was that it was just a big phone; today, that’s what I love about it — like the Watch or AirPods, the iPad feels intuitive and natural to me because it works just like the device I use most often, my phone.

> Like a phone, in most scenarios I find the iPad to be faster, more portable and easier to use and maintain than any traditional P.C. I’ve ever owned. The iPad’s limited screen space and emphasis on full-screen apps also makes for fewer distractions than on a traditional personal computer. The iPad, like my phone, lets me log in to my bank using my face; the Mac, in 2019, doesn’t even have a touch screen.

I'm convinced that perception of the iPad online is warped by it being a great device for writing[^ipadisalsogreatforillustration]. The thing about writing is that it's a baseline feature for a device, because *everyone* does it, even if it's just to send text messages. This means it's one of the most well-supported interaction models on the device, and by extension it's one of the easiest types of apps for developers to implement. This is why, for example, there are [seemingly](https://ia.net/writer) [endless](https://ulysses.app/) [great](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) [writing](https://bear.app/) [apps](https://bywordapp.com/) on the iPad, but only a couple of great [image](https://www.pixelmator.com/ios/) [editors](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/), and only one [great video editor](https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/). For each of those tasks you're walking up a scale of how common the task is, and how much support you get out of the box for it as a developer. So there's a lot of great apps for text editing, less for image editing, and even less than that for video editing. This all comes back to why it's a great device for writing, and of course it's natural for writers to share their opinions online, because that's a great use of writing. So that's what we see around online, writers sharing their opinions about the iPad, in particular about how they are able to write on an iPad.

The only time Manjoo breaks out from his own workflow is when he references a conversation with [Dan Seifert](https://twitter.com/dcseifert), deputy editor at [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/):

> The iPad still can’t do everything a laptop can, and I still have to log in to a “real” computer sometimes. I had a long chat recently with Dan Seifert, the deputy editor of the Verge, who uses an iPad every day on the subway but often finds the device infuriating.

> “For someone like me, who’s been using a desktop operating system for a long time, there’s a lot of built-in conventions that I’m used to that can be frustrating,” Seifert said. In particular, the iPad doesn’t work with antiquated work flows that are built for PCs. Say you need to log into your company’s bespoke publishing system or expense program? It’s possible those won’t work on your iPad — at least not yet — because they were built for much older devices.  

"Antiquated work flows"? Really? What about the state-of-the-art way that the very website that his article is being shared on is designed and built? Sure, there's obviously some organizational separation between an opinion columnist and the people who design and build [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) digital products, but surely he's aware that those jobs exist? Perhaps he isn't also aware that none of the tools they use to do their jobs even run on iPads?

[^ipadisalsogreatforillustration]: Along with writing, illustration is another field where the iPad really shines. And to complete the trio of great iPad use cases, the third is "in the field" work such as reviewing footage on site at a video shoot, or photos at a photo shoot, cases where the form factor benefits outweigh the workflow deficiencies.
