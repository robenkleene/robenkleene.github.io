The [new 16" MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/) [is available to buy now](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/), and it sounds like a hit, a return to form. Physical Esc key, inverted-T arrow keys, and of course, a return to a [scissor-switch keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Scissor-switch_keyboard). There are a lot of [great reviews](https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16) around. Phil Schiller also [appeared on Jonathan Morrison's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjfxcL1S8Dc), don't miss [this section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VV8e3BOOzc) where Schiller shares some details about what's been going on behind the scenes at Apple around their pro product lines.

The overarching marketing message is about listening to pro customers, Schiller [shared some details](https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/) with [Roger Cheng](https://twitter.com/RogerWCheng) at [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/) about how customer feedback was incorporated into the design of the new keyboard:

> A few years back, we decided that while we were advancing the butterfly keyboard, we would also -- specifically for our pro customer -- go back and really talk to many pro customers about what they most want in a keyboard and did a bunch of research. That's been a really impressive project, the way the engineering team has gotten into the physiology of typing and the psychology of typing -- what people love. [...]

> As we started to investigate specifically what pro users most wanted, a lot of times they would say, "I want something like this Magic Keyboard, I love that keyboard." And so the team has been working on this idea of taking that core technology and adapting it to the notebook, which is a different implementation than the desktop keyboard, and that's what we've come up with [for] this new keyboard. We're doing both in advancing the butterfly keyboard, and we're creating this new Magic Keyboard for our Pro notebooks.

> To make this new scissor mechanism work appropriately in a notebook, we had to adapt it to the angle, which is different in a notebook than in a slanted desktop design for ergonomics. And it had to work in a design that had a backlight, which the notebook has that desktops do not.

> While the team was doing it, they discovered there were some things we liked about the butterfly keyboard, like the way it created this whole stable key platform at the top. We wanted to enhance the switch mechanism to support that kind of a feel, and we learned a little bit about the acoustics and the psychology of what is pleasing when you click a key. We had to advance the rubber dome design underneath the key to create the right feel and pressure. We had to increase the travel in the notebook back to about a millimeter because a lot of pros like a little bit longer travel, yet fit it into a thin and light design.

> Throughout the process, the team reexamined the ideal size key cap -- you can make it too big, and there's not much space between them -- and people felt that that we wanted to provide a little more space between the keys than the butterfly mechanism has for optimal feel for professional typists.

This all sounds great, but the interesting question is what had changed at Apple where they'd been shipping laptops everyone loved[^everyonelovedthem] for years, and then all of a sudden 2015 hits and the butterfly keyboard happens.

If I had to wager a guess, I'd say what changed is caution. The iPad, and above all the iPhone, have an aura of caution around them. While the iPhone does make the occasionally risky moves, like removing the headphone jack, there are other areas where they feel like they weren't released until *they were perfect*. Removing the home button from the iPhone X is the canonical example. I've seen anyone point out what a triumph that was, the iPhone's core mechanics button was removed and it was replaced *by gestures*. Gestures! The iPhone X gestures that replaced the home button are the satisfying crack the ball makes when you've hit the sweet spot and it's a home run. It's unequivocal proof that Apple still got it, and the fact that *nobody is even talking about it* is what makes that clear as day.

Other times caution means holding back, the [iPad's molasses-like multi-tasking gestures](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207582) haven't been allowed touch the iPad's core user experience of using one app at a time yet. Because they just aren't ready, putting those interactions front-and-center in the iPad user experience would be a butterfly-keyboard like catastrophe.

It feels to me like whatever mechanism Apple has in place to helps them refine great ideas, and keep them from shipping lousy ones, was absent from the Mac product line from 2015-2018, and is now back in place. The guard rails are back.

The reason this is such great news for Mac fans is that shipping changes like the iPhone X's home button removal *feels expensive*. Whoever's job it is to make sure changes like that are well-executed time is going to be a premium. For 2015-2018, it felt like the Mac just wasn't worth those people's time, but now they're back again. Which means that Apple is investing in the Mac again.
