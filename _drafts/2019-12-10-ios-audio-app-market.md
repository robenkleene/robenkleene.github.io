The [2019 Audio Developer Conference](https://adc19.sched.com/) has a video of a panel titled ["Mobile vs. Desktop Software: Fragmented or Converging Practices?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKQvcqxFbo). It's moderated by [AudioKit Pro](https://audiokitpro.com) co-founder [Matthew Fecher](https://twitter.com/analogMatthew). The list of panelists are:

* [Gaz Williams](https://twitter.com/gazgoldstar), [Sonic State](https://sonicstate.com/) contributor
* [Henny tha Bizness](https://twitter.com/hennythabizness),  Grammy-award winning producer ([who works primarily on iPad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItCj676GmA)) 
* [Henrik Lenberg](https://twitter.com/lenberg), Founder of [Auxy](https://auxy.co/)
* Matt Derbyshire, ex-Head of Product & Marketing at [Ampify](https://ampifymusic.com/)

Fecher talked to a few indie iOS audio app developers who were willing to share some sales numbers about their apps. [This section starts at 25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKQvcqxFbo&t=25m35s), I've summarized the sales numbers below.

## Indie Developer 1: Audio Damage

Most of the developers Fecher spoke to chose to stay anonymous, but not [Chris Randall](https://twitter.com/Chris_Randall) from [Audio Damage](https://www.audiodamage.com/). Audio Damage has a suite of plugins available, most of which are available on both iOS and desktop. Here's how their revenue breaks down:

- There's a 50/50 split of revenue between desktop and iOS.
- The mobile apps are priced at 1/8 the price of their desktop counterparts.
- So there's eight times the sales on iOS but at 1/8 the price.

## Indie Developer 2: New Synth

The second developer Fecher spoke to had just released a new synth on both iOS and desktop. Here's how revenue broke down for the first two months after launch:

- 33% of revenue came from iOS.
- Desktop revenue was $13,000, and iOS was $6,922.
- The iOS app version was priced at 1/10 the cost of the desktop version.

## Indie Developer 3: iPad Synth

The third developer had a synth that's only available on iPad, their revenue broke down as follows:

- $125,000 in total revenue.
- $80,500 in proceeds, so that's after factoring in Apple's 30% cut and other App Store costs.
- $6,000 a month in average sales for the last three months
- This app was not featured by Apple.

## Indie Developer 4: Adding AUv3

The fourth developer shared their data after adding [AUv3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiounit) to their app, which resulted in a boost to sales.

- $4,000 in revenue for the previous month before adding AUv3.
- $15,000 in revenue the month after adding AUv3.s
- They calculated that adding AUv3 resulted in ~$33,000 in extra revenue over the first three months after adding it.

## Indie Developer 5: iOS to Mac

The final developer had one music app app that was initially released for iPad, that was then expanded to iPhone and Mac. Their sales breakdown on each platform is as follows:

- 25% of sales come from iPhone, 35% from iPad, and 40% from Mac.
- $500,000 in total sales over the last three years.
- The iOS version is priced 1/2 the price of the Mac version.

## There's Something Happening Here

There's undoubtably something happening with iOS music apps. It appears to be one of the most active creative app markets, the [Audiobus Forum](https://forum.audiob.us/) is an extremely active community. It's easily the most active forum for iOS music making, but it also may be the most active music making community there is period. And it's mostly fueled by a continuous stream of new audio apps being released.

There are some unique characteristics this market relative to other creative app markets. Unlike the drawing app market for example, where there's a clear market winner, [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) is the #1 paid iPad app in the store, the market is much more fragmented. The closest to an overall winner is probably [BeatMaker 3](https://intua.net/) which is currently the #3 paid Music app and #19 overall. Instead of consolidating 

In [a recent iOS DAW poll at the Audiobus forum](https://forum.audiob.us/discussion/32436/ios-daw-and-workflow-poll-2019), the overwhelming winner was the [AUM mixer app](https://kymatica.com/apps/aum), which is primarily an AudioUnit host for other apps, here's what its interface looks like:

It's fascinating for an app like this to come out on top for iOS, because the platform itself is built around the single app experience. I believe this is partially the result of modularity being an inevitable result of an app store market that doesn't facilitate big winners.

The fragmentation of the market reminds me a lot of the [golden age of OS X indie development](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/), pre-iPhone, when lots of interesting innovative apps were being developed and released by very small companies, often just one person. The problem is an ecosystem like that is incredibly fragile, as the release of the iPhone and Apple's change in priorities has shown. Many of the apps from the 2000s indie development scene are gone now, precious few developers from that era were able to transition to health companies that maintained their apps over time. But the true legacy of the OS X indie app movement is the iPhone App Store, 

The iOS audio market has the same problem as creative apps on the iPhone and Mac app stores in general, there are few steady businesses to serve as an anchors in the industry. The most successful cross-device example is probably the [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) line of apps by [Serif](https://www.serif.com/en-us/), but they still [struggle with popularity](https://uxtools.co/tools/design/). What I'd like to see is Adobe like success on the App Store.
