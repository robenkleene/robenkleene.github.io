An [algorithmic architecture promotional spot for the new Mac Pro](https://mvsm.com/project/imac-pro) by [ManvsMachine](https://mvsm.com/):

> Apple approached ManvsMachine as one of six renowned artists challenged with pushing the iMac Pro to its limits.

> We created a base algorithmic structure that served as a blueprint for each form and movement in the film. The CGI architectural structures were covered in high‑resolution photographic textures and embellished using a custom‑designed system that controls the foliage, architectural details, and other nuances. The result is a monolithic structure of massive scale and incredible detail.

There's a short behind the scene video that explains a bit about how it was created on the Mac Pro with [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/).
