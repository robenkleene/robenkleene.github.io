Jeff Han's multi-touch interface demo for his 2006 TED Talk, ['The Radical Promise of the Multi-Touch Interface'](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_the_radical_promise_of_the_multi_touch_interface) , includes many innovations that are often attributed to the iPhone, announced a year later, including pinch to zoom. He also refers to the software as "apps", and "the interface disappears" is a direct quote. This is a great example of what I'm getting at with with [my previous post](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/04/11/a-few-smart-people-in-a-room/) about how the best paradigms for a new platform are usually discovered early.
