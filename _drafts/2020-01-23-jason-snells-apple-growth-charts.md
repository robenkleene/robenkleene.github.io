[Jason Snell](https://twitter.com/jsnell) [shared a bunch of charts](https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/fun-with-charts-a-decade-of-apple-growth/) that trace Apple's growth in various product lines from 2009 to 2019. [Per John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/01/16/fun-with-charts), that last one's a doozy. If you're trying to figure out why Apple is neglecting their products for creative users, then there's your reason. This also means that any argument for why Apple should give more attention to the Mac, that's based around *Mac revenue*, isn't going to fly, because that's just not enough revenue. A better argument is that the entire iOS ecosystem, from the OS itself, to all of the apps, to the majority of the *content in the apps* is created on Macs. Could all this be moved to other platforms, without hurting the iPhone cash cow? Maybe, but I sure wouldn't want to risk it.
