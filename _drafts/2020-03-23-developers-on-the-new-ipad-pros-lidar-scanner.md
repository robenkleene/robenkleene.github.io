[^renerichtieinstagram]: I don't know what to make of the fact that this was first published on Rene [Rene Ritchie's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reneritchie/). Similarly, the previous video [with Craig Federighi demoing the iPad Pro's new trackpad](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/03/19/craig-federighi-demos-the-ipads-new-trackpad/), appears to have been first released on [The Verge's article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185188/ipad-trackpad-how-to-support-mouse-cursor).
