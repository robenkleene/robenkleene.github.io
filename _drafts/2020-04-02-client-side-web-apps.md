An interesting characteristic of the new wave of web apps is that they run client side. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), for example, runs [C++ code compiled to WebAssembly client side](https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/), and email startup [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) also runs client side as [Sarah Perez](https://twitter.com/sarahintampa) [writes for TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/rapportive-founders-new-startup-superhuman-is-what-gmail-would-be-if-built-today/)[^superhumantechpost]:

> Unlike most browser-based email, which is server-based, Superhuman can store and index gigabytes of email in the web browser itself. This is possible by leveraging todayâ€™s more powerful APIs in the browser, along with the faster CPUs and hard drives on our computers.
