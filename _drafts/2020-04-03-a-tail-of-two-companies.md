On the day after [The Omni Group had layoffs](https://inessential.com/2020/03/31/looking_for_work), web collaboration startup [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) announced they've raised a series A round of $50 Million, as [Erin Griffith](https://twitter.com/eringriffith) [reports for The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/technology/notion-startup-fund-raising.html). Per the article, Notion is also already profitable[^whimsicalisalsoprofitable].

[^whimsicalisalsoprofitable]: Notably, [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/), another web startup that competes directly one of The Omni Group's products, [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), [announced they've reached profitability as of May last year](https://twitter.com/KasparsDancis/status/1129125950292090880). Coincidentally, [Whimsical also integrates nicely with Notion](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1229907609970331648).
