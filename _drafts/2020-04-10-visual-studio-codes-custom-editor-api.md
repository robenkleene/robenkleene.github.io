An [interesting new API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that allows replacing *the entire text editing engine*. They included a list of use cases:

> - Previewing assets, such as shaders or 3D models, directly in VS Code.
> - Creating WYSIWYG editors for languages such as Markdown or XAML.
> - Offering alternative visual renderings for data files such as CSV or JSON or XML.
> - Building fully customizable editing experiences text files.

It will be fascinating to see how far the [text-editor-as-platform](https://twitter.com/robenkleene/status/1228353731663671297) gets pushed.
