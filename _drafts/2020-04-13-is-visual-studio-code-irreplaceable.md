title: "Is Visual Studio Code Irreplaceable?"

I keep thinking about [this post about `git` being irreplaceable ](https://fossil-scm.org/forum/forumpost/b251b6e48e) with respect to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I don't see how another text editor will ever be able to compete with VSCode, here's how we got here:

- **Pre-2004:** [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) are all great text editors in their own right, but all have idiosyncrasies that, while beloved by people like me, prevent them from ever being the *most popular* text editor.
- **2004:** [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is released, with its focus on packages to extend the editor and add support for different programming languages, but its API is still too limited to truly be a platform.
- **2008:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is released, with a more sophisticated API,   facilitating more powerful packages, but package management is still an afterthought.
- **2014:** [Atom](https://atom.io/) is released, bringing package management to the forefront, but Atom has performance problems.
- **2015:** Visual Studio Code is released, keeping packages front and center while also solving Atom's performance issues. As far as I can tell, this essentially represents the final form for (mainstream) text editors.

I don't see how VSCode can ever being contested again, unless its team makes a grave strategic error. We've seen over and over again, that once a platform takes off, its momentum creates a moat that's almost impossible for challengers to overcome.
