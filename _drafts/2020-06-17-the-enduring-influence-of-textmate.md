[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is arguably the most influential text editor ever made.

Among the numerous features it popularized:

1. [Abbreviation-Based Snippets](https://macromates.com/manual/en/snippets)
2. [Auto-Paired Characters](https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_text#auto-paired_characters_quotes_etc)
3. [Fuzzy-Finding by File Name](https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_multiple_files#moving_between_files_with_grace).

All of these features have been built-in in to every subsequent popular text editor. In addition, the [Scope Selectors](https://macromates.com/manual/en/scope_selectors) and [theming](https://macromates.com/manual/en/themes) implementation TextMate pioneered form the basis of themes, syntax highlighting, and scoping language-specific functionality in every subsequent popular text editor.
