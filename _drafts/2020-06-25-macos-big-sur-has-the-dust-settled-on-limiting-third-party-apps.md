title: "macOS Big Sur: Has the Dust Settled on Limiting Third-Party Apps?"

Apple's strategy for years has been to [trade desktop power for cross-device feature parity](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/10/23/iwork-13-a-huge-regression/). As expected, [macOS Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/) continues this trend, emphasizing a consistent user interface across devices, and focusing on cross-device development technologies like [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and [Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/).

Personally, I wish Apple had different priorities. I'd like to see more apps like [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), an industry-leading creative app built top to bottom on Apple technologies. But Sketch was released in 2010, and Apple hasn't created any new frameworks like [Core Graphics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics) and [Core Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage), that support these kinds of use cases in over a decade. So I wasn't holding my breath for them to announce any new support for these kinds of apps at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) this year.

Since Apple isn't prioritizing powerful desktop apps with their own technologies, that means supporting these use cases mostly falls on third parties. This is where companies like [Adobe](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/?promoid=29NMCNT6&mv=other), [Avid](https://www.avid.com/), [Maxon](https://www.maxonlift.com/), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) come in. While Apple's priorities regarding their own technologies have been clear for awhile now, what hasn't been clear is their priorities for third-party apps, in particular, ones that aren't sandboxed. The trend for the last few years has been making it harder to develop these kinds of apps for macOS. [AEpocalypse](https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave) (2018), [Catalina's security features](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/23/annoying-catalina-security-features/) (2019), and [Notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution) (2018) are all examples of this trend.

The overarching reason behind the changes that make these apps harder to develop is "Security", and unlike cross-device feature parity, it's unclear exactly where this all ends. Because after all, the most secure system there is, is the one that doesn't run any software at all. That's why it's such a pleasant surprise, that, as far as I can tell, Apple has done everything they can to make Big Sur, and the accompanying transition to [Apple Silicon](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/), as seamless as possible, even for apps that aren't sandboxed.

Some were predicting next version of Big Sur wouldn't even run apps from outside of the Mac App Store, that didn't happen. It [seemed more likely](https://shapeof.com/archives/2020/6/educated_guesses_about_a_mac_transition_to_arm.html) that Apple would drop [OpenCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) and [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL), but those are [coming along for the ride](https://twitter.com/colincornaby/status/1275153748348682240) to Big Sur. No details were known about whether there would be an emulation layer, like the [original Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29) from the [2006 Intel transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple's_transition_to_Intel_processors). Apple appears to have gone above in beyond with [Rosetta 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment), which supports plug-ins like [VSTis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology), giving lots of options for migration paths for powerful modular software.

I'm still frustrated that there probably won't be another Sketch for the foreseeable future, but that's something I've already accepted. And no other platform has a Sketch either, an industry defining app that's a platform exclusive. So Apple has lost a unique advantage that they had, but they haven't lost anything that other platforms already have. Other platforms can run powerful modular software that's distributed outside the Mac App Store, but today, so can new Macs running Big Sur. Here's to hoping that the dust has settled, and the last of the restrictions on third-party apps are behind us now.
