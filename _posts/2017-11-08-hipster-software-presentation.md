I gave a fun little talk to my co-workers on some of my favorite, more esoteric software tools I use daily. The slides are [available as a PDF](/assets/2017-11-08-hipster-software.pdf). 

The reset of the assets are available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/robenkleene/hipster-software).
