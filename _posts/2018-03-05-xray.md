[atom/xray: An experimental next-generation Electron-based text editor](https://github.com/atom/xray):

> Xray is an experimental Electron-based text editor informed by what we've learned in the four years since the launch of Atom. In the short term, this project is a testbed for rapidly iterating on several radical ideas without risking the stability of Atom. The longer term future of the code in this repository will become clearer after a few months of progress. For now, our primary goal is to iterate rapidly and learn as much as possible.

Development appears to be lead by [Nathan Sobo](https://twitter.com/nathansobo) who [spearheaded much of the early work](https://changelog.com/podcast/241) on [Atom](https://github.com/atom). It has some ambitious performance goals:

> * `8ms`: Scrolling, animations, and fine-grained interactions such as typing or cursor movement.
> * `50ms`: Coarse-grained interactions such as opening a file or initiating a search. If we can't complete the action within this window, we should show a progress bar.
> * `150ms`: Opening an application window.
