Drew DeVault [writes about the POSIX shell](https://drewdevault.com/2018/02/05/Introduction-to-POSIX-shell.html):

> What the heck is the POSIX shell anyway? Well, the POSIX (the Portable Operating System Interface) shell is the standard Unix shell - standard meaning it was formally defined and shipped in a published standard. This makes shell scripts written for it portable, something no other shell can lay claim to. The POSIX shell is basically a formalized version of the venerable Bourne shell, and on your system it lives at `/bin/sh`, unless youâ€™re one of the unlucky masses for whom this is a symlink to bash.

If you're on macOS then unfortunately you're part of those "unwashed messes" that symlink[^symlink] `/bin/sh` to `bash`. This has some interesting implications, in that even if you use the `#!/bin/sh` [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) in your scripts, they won't be guaranteed to be portable to other (Unix and Linux) systems. I've found a practical solution is to just use the `bash` shebang, `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, which will make your scripts portable to any other system running `bash`.

[^symlink]: It appears that technically [it's not a symlink](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3177477?start=0&tstart=0), but in practice in behaves close enough.
