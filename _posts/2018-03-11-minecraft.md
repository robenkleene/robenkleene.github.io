David Cole describes [playing *Minecraft* with his son](https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/playing-minecraft-with-my-son.html) for *The Cut*:

> When we play *Minecraft* together, the direction of his development, and thus our relationship, is reversed: He converts the world into expressions of his own fantasies and dreams. And by letting me enter and explore those dream worlds with him, I come to understand him in a way that the games from my childhood do not.

> Touring the worlds that my son has settled over the last couple of years, I find a lot of the imagery one might expect from a kid his age. Throughout are standard fantasies like living in a treehouse or on a boat. The dominant themes vary as I pass through time: trains in his earliest worlds, then robots, a long streak of pyramids. Pirate ships, particularly half-sunken ones with treasure chests, remain a constant.

It'll be fascinating to see what kids who have been creating worlds their whole lives do when they grow up.
