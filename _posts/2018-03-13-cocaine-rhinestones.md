Great [write-up](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/cocaine-and-rhinestones-is-the-country-podcast-you-need-to-hear-to-believe/?mbid=homepage-more-latest-and-video) by Stephen M. Deusner for Pitchfork on country music podcast [“Cocaine & Rhinestones”](https://cocaineandrhinestones.com/) just wrapping up its first season:

> Early one morning in 1957, country singer Ernest Tubb barged into the lobby of the National Life Building in downtown Nashville, withdrew a revolver from his holster, and shot at a person he thought was Jim Denny. Formerly the gatekeeper at the Grand Ol’ Opry and currently a concert promoter and song publisher, Denny was the guy who fired Hank Williams and told Elvis Presley he had no future in the music business. He was also still asleep in bed, which ended up not mattering anyway: Tubb, who had spent the week binge-drinking, hit only walls. Nevertheless, he was arrested and thrown in the drunk tank, which for him meant buying cigarettes for the cops and playing a few songs at the station.
