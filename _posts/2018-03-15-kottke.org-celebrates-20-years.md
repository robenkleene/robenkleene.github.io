[Twenty.](https://kottke.org/18/03/twenty):

> I had a personal realization recently: kottke.org isn’t so much a thing I’m making but a process I’m going through. A journey. A journey towards knowledge, discovery, empathy, connection, and a better way of seeing the world. Along the way, I’ve found myself and all of you. I feel so so so lucky to have had this opportunity.

What I've always loved about kottke.org is that more than any other site it makes blogging feel, not like a continuation of other forms writing and publishing, but like a medium all its own.
