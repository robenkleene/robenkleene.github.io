A new search utility from Keming Labs called [Finda](https://keminglabs.com/finda/), it looks a lot like [some](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2016/03/17/live-search/) of [the](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2018/03/08/fd-for-find-files/) [things](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2018/03/04/safari-history/) I do with [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). The developer, [Kevin Lynagh](https://twitter.com/lynaghk), has an interesting  [post about Finda's architecture](https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/), which uses [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

[Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014), [LaunchBar 6](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) and `fzf` generally have this use case covered for me, but I'm fascinated by the growing trend of performance-orientated applications using Rust for a backend, [some](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) [other](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2018/03/05/xray/) [examples](https://github.com/google/xi-editor).
