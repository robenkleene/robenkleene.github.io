Matt Gemmell on the direction the wind is blowing for [the future of iOS and the Mac](https://mattgemmell.com/a-big-phone/):

> But you don’t need a Mac. You need Xcode on the iPad. That’s all. [...]

> There’s no particular reason you can’t write and debug code on an iPad, and it’s going to happen. Same for Logic, and Final Cut, and Photoshop, and so on. Oh sure, maybe it won’t be those specific apps (though in a lot of cases, it will be), but tasks themselves are always more interface-agnostic than you think.

I see where he's coming from, and there's a part of me that agrees, or I should say that really wants to agree. The architecture of iOS is fundamentally more secure and easier to use than macOS, and I love fantisizing about a future where it's the only OS I ever need to use.

But the mistake I think he's making is equating programming to just another task. For computers, it's not *a* task, it's *the* task; it's what makes everything else possible. And you still can't do it on iOS[^toy]. Has any platform every *retroactively* become a first-class programming platform? They're usually designed to be [bootstrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Software_development) as fast as possible.

I'm increasingly convinced that the process of bootstrapping builds features into the nature of as platform, and that these features can't be retroactively changed or added[^nature]. And if that's true, it means the ship has already sailed on iOS ever being a great programming platform. I really hope Apple proves me wrong.

[^toy]: It's such an obnoxious term, but so perfectly apt I can't help using it: iOS only allows "toy" programming.
[^nature]: For examples of where Apple has tried to go against the nature of macOS, see [Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_(software)), the [Mac App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_App_Store) (especially [sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/)), and replacing "Save As" with "Duplicate" in [Mac OS X Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion).
