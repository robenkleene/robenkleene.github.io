John Gruber [again writing](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/11/19/ipad-pro-snell) about iOS and iPad as a "pro" platform:

> But, I will object to one thing: the iPad feels like a young platform, yes, but it’s not young. It’s over 8 years old. Steve Jobs was still around to introduce it. When the Mac was 8 years old in 1992, System 7 had been launched and it was a very advanced platform, suitable for work of any kind. The new iPad Pro hardware might be the best consumer computer hardware ever made — the only rivals are the iPhone XS and XR. But software-wise, the iPad platform is nowhere near as far along after 8 years as the Mac was a generation ago.

Like many others, I had my stint trying to do more of my work on iOS. For me it was a disaster, I mainly just learned how much I love the Mac as a platform, and that I have an extreme skepticism of whether iOS is even on the path to becoming a pro platform. I stand by [my statement](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2018/04/18/you-dont-need-a-mac/) that not bootstrapping iOS has put a ceiling on its usefulness. It won't reach it its full potential as pro platform until the developers at Apple working on improving iOS everyday are doing that work on iOS devices.
