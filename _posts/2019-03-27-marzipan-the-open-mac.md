Steve Troughton-Smith [tweets highlighting an important issue for Marzipan apps](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1110531865168015360):

> I've been thinking this is gonna be a real problem for Marzipan apps —- if macOS is left as open as it is now, a lot of developers will have to be far more careful with their cache folders. Many unknowingly rely on iOS’ file system being inscrutable…

Due to the open nature of the Mac, all of the data stored locally by Marzipan apps can easily be extracted by the user. This seems like a big deal for pay-walled content apps like news and video services.

This is more fuel on the flame of my biggest worry about Apple's current direction: Apple increasingly seems to believe the open nature of the Mac is a design flaw, and I don't see how they can solve these problems without taking the Unix out of macOS.
