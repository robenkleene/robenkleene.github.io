VoodooPad has been getting some [nice-looking updates](https://www.voodoopad.com/blog/) ever since development was taken over by [Primate Labs](https://www.primatelabs.com/) (makers of [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com)).

VoodooPad was one of the [winners](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/1071) of O'Reilly's short-lived Mac OS X Innovators Contest (2003-2004). Other winners included [Audio Hijack Pro](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/), [Delicious Library](https://www.delicious-monster.com), [LaunchBar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/), [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner), and [SubEthaEdit](https://subethaedit.net). What a track record.
