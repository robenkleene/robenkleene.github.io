[Pixelmator Photo](https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2019/04/02/pixelmator-photo-now-available-for-pre-order-coming-april-9th/) is coming out April 9th (just $4.99, really?). I'm not a big photo editor, but if I were I'd use [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/) because it's the most Mac-like of the available photo editors.

The alternatives are [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) and of course [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). Affinity Photo is supposedly a great app (and it's already on iOS). But a lot of people describe it as feeling like a copy of Photoshop, I prefer apps that try to be their own thing. Adobe's approach has been user-hostile for years, increasingly pushing features designed to lock you into their ecosystem.
