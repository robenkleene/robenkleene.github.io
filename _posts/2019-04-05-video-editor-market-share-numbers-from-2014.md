I [love](/2019/04/01/professional-work-on-the-ipad-in-context/) [discussing](/2019/04/02/sketch-figmas-market-share/) market share numbers for professional tools[^photoshop], so I was happy to find this breakdown on [video editor market share](http://www.learningvideo.com/nle-market-share-breakdown/) by [Dave Dugdale](https://twitter.com/dugdale) from 2014[^finalcut]. Dave polled his audience and received "over 1000" responses:

1. 63% Adobe Premiere Pro
2. 20% Final Cut Pro
3. 14% Sony Vegas Pro
4. 3% Avid Media Composer

[^photoshop]: Before becoming a programmer, I worked as a designer for many years. One of the reasons I care so much about pro apps is that, as a designer, so much of what I learned was just how to use Photoshop effectively. Since these apps are so large and complex, they require a huge investment from the user, and therefore software publishers have a responsibility to manage them appropriately.

[^finalcut]: This poll was conducted in 2014, so that's *after* [the contentious release](https://daringfireball.net/2011/06/final_cut_pro_x_backlash) of Final Cut Pro X.
