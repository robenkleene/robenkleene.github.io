[Jon Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hicks_(designer)), the well-known designer who did some significant work on the iconic Firefox logo, is [using an iPad Pro as his main computer](https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-main-computer)[^podcast]:

> It’s started slowly, but the platform has been maturing and I’ve been using it more and more as my main computer. There are limitations and issues, which I’ll come to, but I keep coming back to it as a my main design tool. There’s something very alluring about this light and portable thin slab of glass that can do (almost) everything I need it to.

Jon is an illustrator[^illustration], so a significant part of his desire to transition is a better illustration workflow, and the Apple Pencil in particular:

> In contrast to all this, the iPad Pro and Pencil felt absolutely delightful immediately, and it’s mostly down to the Pencil. It’s such a beautiful tool to use – its balanced and luxurious in feel. Drawing seems to flow from the hand in a way that it just doesn’t on the Surface. It still doesn’t feel like a real pen, brush or pencil on paper, but has the best feel of any digital drawing tool I’ve ever used.

Definitely don't miss the "[Shortcomings and Workarounds](https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-main-computer#shortcomings)" section which is *extensive*.

[^podcast]: Jon also appeared recently on [Episode 44 of the iPad Pros podcast](https://ipadpros.net/2019/02/07/episode-44-jon-from-hicks-design/).

[^illustration]: Illustration is one of the categories I think will have the easiest time transitioning to an iOS workflow. It's a group that has clearly been waiting for technology like this, with [Wacom Tablets](https://www.wacom.com/en-us) already very popular. The other two types of work that I think transition easily are writing and general office work, mainly in [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office) and [Google Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs).
