Marco Arment recommends the [MrSpeakers Aeon Flow Closed Headphones](https://t.co/bF8mkgJDiL) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1114237702336065536):

> The MrSpeakers Aeon Flow Closed headphones are phenomenal. VERY smooth, present midrange sings with vocals and guitars (like the HE-6!). Bass and treble are a bit light, but not fatally so. Amazing sound for a closed-back design. Strong amp required.

[Marco's](https://marco.org/headphones-bluetooth) [headphone](https://marco.org/headphones-closed-portable) [reviews](https://marco.org/headphones-bluetooth-portable) are the some of the best in the business, so it's great to hear he has a new recommendation. Especially because an audiophile closed back is a category he has never had good things to say about before.
