As Steve Troughton-Smith [points out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1115354467006910471) Apple has updated the [notarization documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution?language=objc) to include the following:

> Beginning in macOS 10.14.5, all new or updated kernel extensions and all software from developers new to distributing with Developer ID must be notarized in order to run. In a future version of macOS, notarization will be required by default for all software.

It's unclear what "developers new to distributing with Developer ID" means, does that mean it'll be a flag to require notarization on all new developer ID accounts? If so, what a revolting policy. I'm a proponent of innovation and I believe the best way to create innovation is to make it as efficient as possible for new players to enter the marketplace. Any policy that benefits long-term players at the expense new players is innovation hostile and is therefore immoral.
