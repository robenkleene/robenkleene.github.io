The [2019 Stackoverflow developer survey results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) are out, which means I can update the data I collected for [another post](/2019/04/01/professional-work-on-the-ipad-in-context/) illustrating the industry-wide takeover by the Electron-based text editors:

1. [2015](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-editor): 2.8% combined, 2.8% Atom
2. [2016](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-development-environments): 19.7% combined, 12.5% Atom, 7.2% Visual Studio Code
3. [2017](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-_-most-popular-developer-environments-by-occupation): 39.6% combined, 17.3% Atom, 22.3% Visual Studio Code
4. [2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments): 52.9% combined, 18% Atom, 34.9% Visual Studio Code
5. [2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools): 64% combined, 13.3% Atom, 50.7% Visual Studio Code

2019 saw another huge jump with Atom and Visual Studio Code up to 64% market share (it's also notable that this is the first year that Atom saw a decline, so soon this will just be called the Visual Studio Code takeover).

This is what an industry in transition looks like, not [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dItCj676GmA&list=PLqcaiHQwxA9jB-o-1-zmujxnbpaqwl9lV), or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZpsliNmJLo) (as great as those videos are).
