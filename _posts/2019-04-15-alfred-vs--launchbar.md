[Dr. Drang](https://twitter.com/drdrang) [compares Alfred and LaunchBar](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/04/back-to-launchbar/), eventually deciding to return to LaunchBar. I also use LaunchBar; I've never seen a reason to switch and I appreciate LaunchBar's pedigree as the [original launcher dating back to NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaunchBar). I'm surprised he doesn't address using Spotlight as a LaunchBar replacement, which has been a possibility ever since Spotlight co-opted LaunchBar's design in [OS X Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite). For me, Spotlight is too slow to replace LaunchBar as a *launcher*[^slowonios] (and its algorithm for learning from past searches also feels rudimentary in comparison) but I use it all the time for searching. That division makes sense to me: LaunchBar is a smaller, faster index of things I access all the time, and Spotlight indexes my whole hard drive for things I access less frequently.

[^slowonios]: On the subject of Spotlight being slow, something that drives me up the wall is Spotlight on iOS sometimes shows the keyboard before it actually accepts keyboard input (this seems to happen more often when Spotlight hasn't been used in awhile, like for the first time in the morning). So if you start typing too soon, those characters are lost and have to be retyped after Spotlight catches its breath. One of the problems with iOS is that there's no way to replace system utilities with third-party applications. On macOS, I would simply replace Spotlight with another application that's faster, but on iOS I'm stuck with this problem until Apple decides to fix it, if ever.
