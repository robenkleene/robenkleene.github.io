Robert Scoble [writes about the huge investment in new technology](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-would-hillel-fuld-do-robert-scoble/) across the industry right now:

> I remember when Eastman Kodak laughed at me when I said that someday digital photos would be 1,000 times more important than chemical photos. I was wrong. I think it's a million times more important now.

> I remember when two guys brought Siri into my house (hi Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer) and, while I thought they would be bought pretty quickly I never thought that that would be the most profitable investment Apple would make. It was the last time I will underestimate Apple's ability, or Steve Jobs. 

> I remember when I was the first to use an email server at the magazine I was working at, and that some in the office didn't appreciate that I was trying to get people to stop sending paper memos.

> So many memories of so many disruptions, but the ones that are about to come are far more wild than the mobile phone.

I have a different perspective on this: After the wild success of the iPhone, companies all want to own a platform now. Most of the investment in VR, AR, and AI are in the hope of growing them into platforms. Companies are willing to invest a lot of money to create a platform, because, as the iPhone has shown us, owning a platform is literally the most lucrative thing there is.

The problem is you can't just R&D a platform into existence. What makes a new platform possible is [the status of complementary technology](/2019/04/11/a-few-smart-people-in-a-room/) (mainly hardware). What you can do is take existing technology and polish it up and make a product out of it, and that's what we have now with Oculus, HoloLens, Alexa, Siri, Magic Leap, and Tesla[^tesla]. But if that's doesn't make a compelling enough product, then you basically have to wait a decade for the complementary technology to improve enough to make a difference before you can try again. What we're seeing now is a whole lot of wheel spinning by companies dreaming of iPhone-shaped dollar signs.
