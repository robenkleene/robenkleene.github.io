In a tour de force episode, [Marco](https://twitter.com/marcoarment), [Casey](https://twitter.com/caseyliss), and [John](https://twitter.com/siracusa) [discuss the break up of iTunes](http://atp.fm/episodes/321) and what means for power users (it's not good).

This is the best summary yet of the dangers facing the Mac, but I still don't think it goes far enough. While removing power user features like metadata editing and smart playlists is annoying, what's really going to blindside Apple is losing software developers, and then, designers---the people who make software. For years Apple has had stranglehold on them because they've provided great GUI tools, while also offering Unix underpinnings. But both of these areas have been neglected *for decades*, by focusing on [UIKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_Touch) instead of [AppKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Kit), and by [letting the Unix underpinnings rot](/2019/04/11/2012-apples-great-gpl-purge/). A funny thing happens when you stop moving forward, *everyone else catches up*.
