[Reeder 4](https://www.reederapp.com/) is out for iOS and macOS and can now be downloaded from their respective app stores. Reeder is my favorite RSS reader so it's great to see a new version. My favorite change is that now it uses the default action menu on iOS. In the older versions, it first brought up a built-in menu, and I had to then tap a second time to access the default action menu.

[As noted by the Reeder app account](https://twitter.com/reederapp/status/1121464129330536449) on Twitter:

> The iOS and the macOS versions now share the same code base. This makes it much easier for me to maintain and add new features. Sorry it took me so long, I hope it was worth the wait.

I'm curious what the developer, Silvio Rizzi, thinks about Marzipan. I'm guessing he's a fan, because Reeder is a very iOS-like Mac app, but I wonder if he'd have put in all this work to merge these code bases if he'd known Marzipan was coming?
