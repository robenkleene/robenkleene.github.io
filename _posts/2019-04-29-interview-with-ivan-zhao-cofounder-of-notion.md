[The InVision blog has a nice interview](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/ivan-zhou-notion-interview/) with [Ivan Zhao](https://twitter.com/ivanhzhao), cofounder of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/):

> Fundamentally, Notion is a tool to solve people’s problems. It’s more about UX. Does this solve people’s problems in the fewest clicks possible? Is this the simplest mental model we can use? And that becomes slightly more objective, less fashion-y, less Dribbble-y. Do that first, then figure out what skin you put on it. Now, our skin is fairly conservative too. Try to be conservative.

Notion, along with [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com), are examples of a new breed of web startup with a lot of appeal: They focus on [iterating on, and refining a product](https://mobile.twitter.com/moeamaya/status/1120044560460083201), rather than launching as soon as possible and focusing on growth.
