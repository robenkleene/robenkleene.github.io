Completing [the](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/05/08/the-future-of-development-on-apple-platforms-is-microsoft/) [trifecta](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/05/09/windows-gets-a-new-terminal/) of recent Microsoft news for developers, Linux Systems Group program manager Jack Hammons writes about [shipping a full Linux kernel with Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/) this summer:

> Beginning with Windows Insiders builds this Summer, we will include an in-house custom-built Linux kernel to underpin the newest version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This marks the first time that the Linux kernel will be included as a component in Windows. This is an exciting day for all of us on the Linux team at Microsoft and we are thrilled to be able to tell you a little bit about it.

Hopefully this will be a wake-up call Apple needs to change course. For decades, the selling point of the Mac for developers has been "[Unix with a Mac GUI](https://daringfireball.net/2004/09/bbedit_8)", but now that comes with a caveat: "Unix with a Mac GUI, but the Mac GUI part isn't maintained anymore and to develop anything with our new stuff, you need our permission". That's a different value proposition, and one that the developer community will reject if given the opportunity (with adequate competition). When you're looking for a big breakthrough, [look for areas of *neglect*](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/04/20/the-deal-that-made-the-iphone/); the Mac as a developer machine is being neglected and is ripe for disruption.
