[Framer introduces Playground](https://www.framer.com/blog/posts/introducing-framer-playground/) which brings back the original paradigm, from the discontinued [Framer Classic](https://classic.framer.com/), of a side-by-side code editor and live preview of what you're editing[^swiftplaygrounds]:

> It’s worth noting that Playground isn't your average code editor. We recognize that as a designer, you require a different workflow for coding, and Playground was built with that in mind. Most designers want direct feedback, a way to freely explore and play while validating ideas, a common facet of creative work. Playground allows you to get started immediately, without being blocked by complex configuration or set-ups. Everything works out-of-the-box, with enough guidance and support to empower you to do what you do best—create.

I love this paradigm because it's easily understandable: What you edit on the left updates live on the right. You can show someone a screenshot of it and they could reasonably guess how it works. Contrast this to the rest of [Framer X](https://www.framer.com/), which seems really powerful but I don't understand how it works.

[^swiftplaygrounds]: A side-by-side code editor and live preview is the same approach used by [Swift Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/).
