[Motiongrapher surveyed their readers in 2015](http://motionographer.com/2016/01/25/2015-hardware-survey-results/) and 854 people responded. One of the questions is about which software they use for creating motion graphics:

1. 96% [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)
2. 90% [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
3. 79% [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
4. 68% [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/)
5. 52% [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)
6. 12% [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)
7. 9% [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)
8. 8% [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke)
9. 7% [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview)
10. 5% [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/)
11. 3% [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
12. 2% [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
13. 1% [Unity](https://unity.com/)

(Surprisingly [Apple's Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(software)) doesn't appear on this list, perhaps it's rolled in with Final Cut Pro?)

After seeing this, I went back and added Adobe's products to the [previous numbers I'd looked at](/2019/04/02/sketch-figmas-market-share/) from the user interface question from [Uxtools.co 2018 design tools survey](https://uxtools.co/survey-2018):

1. 70% [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
2. 21% [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
3. 20% [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
4. 18% [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
5. 18% [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)

Or, another way of looking at this is:

1. 70% Sketch
2. 56% Adobe Products
3. 21% Figma

56% puts Adobe solidly in second place after Sketch. Taken with [previous market share numbers I looked at with video editors](/2019/04/05/video-editor-market-share-numbers-from-2014/), where Adobe Premiere Pro came out ahead with 63%, it paints quite a picture of Adobe's dominance in creative fields. Adobe is also almost certainly dominate in photography with [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and print publishing, with [Adobe InDesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign), neither of which even have any serious competitors. This means Adobe is dominate in photography, video editing, motion graphics, and print publishing, and second place in user-interface design. Not a bad showing.
