[Jason Yuan](https://twitter.com/jasonyuandesign) presents [Mercury OS](https://www.mercuryos.com/): "A speculative vision of the operating system, driven by humane design principles." There's also [an accompanying blog post](https://medium.com/@jasonyuan/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289).

I'm what you would could call an operating-system traditionalist[^cleanslates], but I love seeing these imaginings. I think this kind of approach ("there are no Apps or Folders [...] content and actions are fluidly assembled based on your intentions") can work great on satellite devices[^satellitedevices].

The main question I'd have for Jason, is can you build an OS with this? And if you can't, then how and where do you build this? It's the same question I have for people who think iOS will replace macOS.

[^satellitedevices]: iOS devices are satellite devices to macOS devices: ["Itâ€™s the heaviness of the Mac that allows iOS to remain light."](https://www.macworld.com/article/1156153/macofthefuturegruber.html)

[^cleanslates]: As I grow older I've become increasingly weary of "clean slate" software, re-writes of existing applications but "done right". Over time I've found that this always means a dramatic loss in power. When an existing application is dragged, sometimes kicking and screaming, into the future, it brings with it older methods of working that give it a depth of features missing from newer applications. A couple of examples of this are [Ex commands](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/cmdline.html) in [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), which is how it implements [find and replace](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#:substitute) to this day, and the command line itself in macOS which has been the primary tool that's facilitated progress in programming for the last couple of decades.
