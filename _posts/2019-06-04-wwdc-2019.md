The [WWDC 2019](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/) keynote was streamed live yesterday and should be [available to watch](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101/) soon.

## iPadOS

The iPad wing of iOS will be spun off as [iPadOS](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/). This should mean iPadOS will receive new features annually, as part of the yearly release cycle. Previously it felt like iPad features were always lower priority to iOS features for iPhone.

## Mac Pro

Apple has announced the new [Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/design/). It's expensive, the base model starts at $5,999, and the accompanying [Pro Display XDR](https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/) starts at $4,999 (the stand is $999 extra). This is the best thing Apple has announced in years, because it finally shows a commitment to the high end. I can't wait to see who ends up buying these and what they use them for.

The reason this is so important for everyone is that the high end pulls up everything else. [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) and [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) will be improved to run on and sell this hardware, and those improvements can be run by anybody for $199 and $299 respectively. Other major professional software makers will also take this machine seriously, and most of those applications have affordable options as well.
