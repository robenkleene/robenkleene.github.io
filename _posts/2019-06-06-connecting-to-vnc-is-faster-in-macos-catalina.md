Steve Troughton-Smith [tweets](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1135780593541799936) that it's faster to [connect](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/share-the-screen-of-another-mac-mh14066/10.14/mac/10.14) via [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) on [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina-preview/). I'm [hoping](https://twitter.com/robenkleene/status/1131984224653860869) Apple is working on a remote development environment for iOS, and this is the type of incremental improvement you'd see if that were the case. A remote development environment would mean you could use iOS hardware with macOS software: You could travel with an external keyboard and mouse that you'd only need to use when you use macOS. This is the only way I can see myself switching entirely to iOS hardware as long as [rule 2.5.2](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#2.5.2) exists.
