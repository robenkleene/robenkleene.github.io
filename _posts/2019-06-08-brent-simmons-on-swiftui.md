Brent Simmon's piece, [The NeXT Era Ends, the Swift Era Begins](https://inessential.com/2019/06/07/the_next_era_ends_the_swift_era_begins):

> Though I don’t discount Catalyst’s usefulness — we will get lots of apps new to the Mac — the real news this week was about SwiftUI and the Combine framework. This, finally, is a new way of writing apps, and it’s based on Swift and not on Objective-C. It’s very much not from NeXT.

> It’s early. It has bugs. It’s not nearly complete. Sure. But it’s also how we’re going to write apps in the future.

> And it’s mind-blowing. Apple’s marketing for this year’s WWDC had it right.

> It may be a while before you’re running apps that use SwiftUI and Combine (and who knows what else still to come). We’re in a transition, and transitions take years. But we’ve all just had a glimpse of the next 20 years.

Leading up to WWDC, I [wrote](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/06/03/the-reaper/): "Developers got more functionality for free when they used Cocoa." It's no coincidence that Craig Federighi introduced SwiftUI by [emphasizing that it means writing less code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psL_5RIBqnY&t=128m32s). If you want to try to introduce something revolutionary, it's good a good idea to have an objective reason that it's better; less code is always objectively better.
