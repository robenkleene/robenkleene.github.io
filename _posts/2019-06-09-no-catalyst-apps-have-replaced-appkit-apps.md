As John Gruber [points out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1137516323548880896):

> It is very conspicuous that Apple hasn't abandoned a single one of its AppKit apps in favor of UIKit via Catalyst. Not one.

> Maybe you could argue Podcasts counts, because they could have derived that from iTunes too, like Music and TV. But still: games, media consumption, toys.

I've not going to say I wasn't worried about this before WWDC, because I was. But the combination of Apple's measured Catalyst strategy, [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), and the [new Mac Pro](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/06/04/wwdc-2019/) has put me at ease. I'm once again confident that Apple's long-term strategy includes AppKit.

The reason I was so scared about this is that, based on my analysis of professional software market share[^marketshareanalysis], the outcome of transitioning off of AppKit would be professional markets abandoning the Mac for more hospitable platforms.
