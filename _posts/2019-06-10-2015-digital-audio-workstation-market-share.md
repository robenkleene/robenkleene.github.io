[Ask.Audio polled their readers](https://www.macprovideo.com/article/news/the-top-11-most-popular-daws-you-voted-for) about which digital audio workstation (DAW) they preferred in 2015. They received an impressive 25,000 responses, here's a summary of the results:

1. 23.14% [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/)
2. 16.95% [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)
3. 15.13% [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools)
4. 13.63% [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/)
5. 9.03% [Steinberg Cubase](https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/)
6. 3.80% [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-One)
7. 3.46% [Reason](https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason)
8. 2.49% [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/)
9. 1.99% [Sonar](https://www.cakewalk.com/products/SONAR/)
10. 0.92% [Digital Performer](http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp/)
11. 0.77% [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/en/bitwig-studio)

(Everything else combined got 8.70%.)

One of the great things about the DAW market is how fragmented it is. The market leader, Ableton Live, only has 23.14%. Compare that with the leaders in other markets:

- 96% [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html), [Motion Graphics](/2019/05/30/2015-motion-graphics-software-market-share/)
- 70% [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [User Interface Design](/2019/04/02/sketch-figmas-market-share/)
- 65% [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), [Video Editing (NLE)](/2019/04/05/video-editor-market-share-numbers-from-2014/)

I'm also really curious if Logic Pro X actually has more users than GarageBand.
