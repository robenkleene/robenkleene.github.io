In 2013, [Digital Photography School polled their readers](https://digital-photography-school.com/post-processing-poll-results/) about which post-production software they use. 22,000 people responded, here are the results:

1. 32% [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)
2. 21% [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
3. 12% [Adobe Photoshop Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html)
4. 9% [Picasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa)
5. 8% [Aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_(software))
6. 5% [GIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP)
7. 4% [iPhoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhoto)
8. 3% [PaintShop Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro)
9. 5% Other


This is shortly after [Adobe introduced subscription pricing](https://www.theverge.com/apps/2011/10/3/2466937/adobe-creative-cloud-photoshop-touch-subscription-service), and while Aperture, iPhoto, and Picasa were still around. Adobe [again](/2019/05/30/2015-motion-graphics-software-market-share/) (and [again](/2019/04/05/video-editor-market-share-numbers-from-2014/)) comes out dominate.
