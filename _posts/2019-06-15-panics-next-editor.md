Panic is working on a [new text editor](https://panic.com/next/) to replace [Coda 2](https://www.panic.com/coda/):

> Yes, the next Coda is so different it won’t even be called Coda.

> Frankly, we were worried that developers may have tried Coda in the past, decided it wasn’t for them, and written the app off forever. This new version is so new, it deserves a fresh start.

> And then, incredibly, a new Coda arrived on the scene — a reimagined document at coda.io — and we reached an agreement to let them have the name. They’re Coda now. And we’re free to look to the future.

They've shared a [couple](https://twitter.com/panic/status/1123651547924033538) ([fullsize](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5gDH8rVUAEzCje.jpg:large)) of [screenshots](https://twitter.com/panic/status/1138186299607724032) ([fullsize](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8umZ2wVUAApcO0.jpg:large)) on Twitter.

I'm extremely excited about a new native text editor to [compete with Visual Studio Code](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/04/10/2019-stackoverflow-developer-survey-results/).
