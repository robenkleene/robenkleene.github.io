[Adobe Lightroom is back in the Mac App Store](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692377/adobe-lightroom-mac-app-store-available-price). It was last available in 2012, around the time when [App Sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/) became a requirement, and Adobe Creative Cloud was ramping up. The version that's in the Mac App Store today is of course the new ["Lightroom"](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) version, and not the full-featured ["Lightroom Classic"](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html):

> The Mac App Store version of Lightroom is the “new” Lightroom formerly known as Lightroom CC, which syncs with complementary mobile and tablet apps and has a different UI to what is now called Lightroom Classic.

This is an interesting solution to the sandboxing dilemma: It's impossible to sandbox Lightroom Classic, just as it's impossible to sandbox every other industry-leading creative application. So this is a way to get these applications into Apple's ecosystem while continuing to offer the full-featured versions to professionals: Make a stripped-down version with a similar name, and add *that* version to Apple's ecosystem. I bet Adobe's [upcoming Photoshop for iPad](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17969754/adobe-photoshop-apple-ipad-creative-cloudhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17969754/adobe-photoshop-apple-ipad-creative-cloud) will follow this model closely. (In case you're wondering, [Lightroom Classic continues to be updated](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/whats-new.html).)
