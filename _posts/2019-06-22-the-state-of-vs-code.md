[Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif), [Raphael Benitte](https://twitter.com/benitteraphael), and [Michael Rambeau](https://twitter.com/michaelrambeau) have conducted a pair of polls on [JavaScript](https://2018.stateofjs.com/other-tools/) (from 2018), and [CSS](https://2019.stateofcss.com/other-tools/) (from this year), they received over 20,000 and 10,000 responses respectively. This shows some more indication of [the dominance of Visual Studio Code](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/04/10/2019-stackoverflow-developer-survey-results/), this time by looking at web developers in isolation.

## The State of JavaScript

1. 72% [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. 22% [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. 22% [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
4. 21% [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
5. 17% [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## The State of CSS

1. 71% [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. 34% [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
3. 22% [Atom](https://atom.io/)

For each of the surveys I included all of the entries down to Atom, to get a general sense of where the [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) editors stand
