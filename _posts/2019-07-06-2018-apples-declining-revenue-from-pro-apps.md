title: "2018 Apple's Declining Revenue From \"Pro Apps\""
categories: Old, News, Professional

Horace Dediu compiled a chart[^asymcomethodology] for Asymco [showing a decline in revenue](http://www.asymco.com/2018/10/04/traffic-acquisition-costs/) from "Pro Apps". The decline starts at the end of 2014, and by 2018, where the chart ends, revenue is at its lowest since 2005, where the chart begins. Before the decline starts, revenue from pro apps had been steadily rising since 2005, the contrast is more stark when compared to [a similar chart from 2014](http://www.asymco.com/2014/07/29/how-big-is-apples-ecosystem/).

Here's a few events whose timing might be relevant:

- **2011:** Final Cut Pro X was released.
- **2013:** Logic Pro X was released.
- **2013:** The cylindrical "trash can" Mac Pro was released.

Of these events, I'd guess the poorly received 2013 Mac Pro had the most negative impact, followed by the release of Final Cut Pro X. But I don't think either those events adequately explain this drop in revenue.

[^asymcomethodology]: It's unclear what Dediu's methodology is for compiling these charts, [he explains it a bit](http://www.asymco.com/2013/10/24/the-value-of-zero-priced-software/), but I don't find it convincing:

	> The historic performance Apple’s Software business is not easily determined since it was always blended with additional businesses. Until September of last year, Software was reported as part of “Software and Services” and since then as part of “iTunes, Software and Services.” Some assumptions allow the following picture to be drawn.

	So I'm taking the charts at face value based purely on Dediu's reputation.
