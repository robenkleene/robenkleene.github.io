The Panic account [tweets](https://twitter.com/panic/status/1154210018851352576?s=12) explaining why [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/) will not be in the Mac App Store:

> Thereâ€™s no way Nova can be in the MAS [Mac App Store]. It relies heavily on extensions and any number of arbitrary command line executables which are a no-go under sandboxing.

This highlights issues with the Mac App Store; Programming is an ideal task for the Mac, because most programming tools aren't allowed on iOS at all. But programming tools aren't allowed in the Mac App Store either.

Whether intentionally or not, this strategy ends up communicating two sentiments:

1. Don't use a Mac (because a Mac can't do anything that iOS can't).
2. Don't write programs (because you can't write programs on iOS).
