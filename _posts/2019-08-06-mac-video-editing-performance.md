Previously, I [shared a video](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/06/06/2016-editing-4k-video-on-a-macbook/) of Jonathan Morrison editing 4K video on a 12" MacBook after [Linus Sebastian](https://twitter.com/linustech) had failed to do so on an ultrabook running Windows. In explaining the difference, I wrote:

> The differentiating factor is that Jonathan uses Final Cut Pro, whereas Linus uses Adobe Premiere Pro. Final Cut Pro uses background rendering and Intel Quick Sync Video to stay responsive with less resources.

Now there's a new video from [Matthew Moniz](https://twitter.com/mattmoniz) comparing video rendering and playback on a MacBook Pro to several PC laptops, but this time running [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), which would seemingly eliminate some of Final Cut Pro's optimization advantages since Premiere is cross-platform. But again, the MacBook Pro comes out on top, beating all three PC laptops in both rendering and playback performance using Premiere. In summary for the Jonathan Morrison video I wrote:

> This is a great example of the difference between specs and real world usage, the ultrabook comes out ahead in specs, but the MacBook performs better in real world usage.

The same sentiment is apt here: Specs and benchmarks are unreliable indicators of performance in real world usage.

Moniz has [a follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9ytgOdP7U) comparing an iMac, a MacBook Pro, iMac Pro, and a PC desktop. In these tests, the PC fairs better. Moniz's overall recommendation is the 2019 iMac, but with the caveat that 3D rendering (using Cinema 4D and Blender) and games performed significantly better on the PC.

3D rendering is a weakness for Apple right now, especially since there's no platform-exclusive equivalent to Final Cut Pro for 3D. I'm hopeful the 3D situation will improve with the release of the [new Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/), and there's some indication of that happening: [Redshift](https://www.redshift3d.com/), [Octane](https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/), and [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/) [are all being developed for Metal](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/pro-app-developers-react-to-the-new-mac-pro-and-pro-display-xdr/), and Apple's releasing [Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/reality-composer/), a new 3D app for developers.
