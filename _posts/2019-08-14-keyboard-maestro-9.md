[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/), the venerable Mac automation app, just released [version 9](https://www.stairways.com/press/2019-08-13)[^keyboardmaestronevermacappstore] with [Dark Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976) and OCR support.

I've used Keyboard Maestro for years to setup keyboard shortcuts to run AppleScripts and to automate many other things that [AppleScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript) or [Automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac) can't do.
