A new 20th anniversary edition of my all-time favorite programming book, [*The Pragmatic Programmer*](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition). Better than any other book, *The Pragmatic Programmer* captures the minutiae of programming as a craft, and seeing programming through that lens has increased my enjoyment of it immensely. I also believe that this is the first time *The Pragmatic Programmer* has ever been available through [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com), the publishing company authors Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas started after the success of the book.
