[School of Motion polled their community](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/2019-motion-design-survey) and received over 1,000 responses. The survey included two questions about software, asking what their most, and second most, used software were.

## Most Used Software

1. 77% [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)
2. 10% [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/)
3. 6% [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
4. 5% [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
5. 4% [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

## Second Most Used Software

1. 29% [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
2. 21% [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)
3. 17% [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
4. 17% [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/)
5. 15% [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Just like when [I looked at](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/05/30/2015-motion-graphics-software-market-share/) [Motiongrapher's survey from 2015](http://motionographer.com/2016/01/25/2015-hardware-survey-results/), my biggest surprise is that [Apple's Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(software)) doesn't show up anywhere on these lists. This is an industry that's completely controlled by Adobe, albeit a smaller one than other areas where Adobe competes like photography and video editing.
