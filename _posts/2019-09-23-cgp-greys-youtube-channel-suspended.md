Popular [YouTuber CGP Grey's](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) Google account has been [suspended](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/status/1175681091165966336). His videos are still up, but he cannot login to his Google account to manage them or upload more. This is a chilling reminder that when your business is built on someone else's platform, the rug can be pulled out from under you at any moment. The unfortunate reality is that if you're a content creator, due to the power [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), it's probably impossible to avoid being on someone else's platform, because that's where the audience is. The key is understanding that this isn't ideal and designing the rest of your business to mediate its impact. You should always still have your own URL where people can find your content and follow you, and more importantly, if you don't need the audience a platform provides, *then don't use a platform that you have no control over at all*.
