Popular [YouTuber CGP Grey's](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey) Google account has been [suspended](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/status/1175681091165966336). His videos are still up, but he cannot login to his Google account to manage them or upload more. This is a chilling reminder that when your business is built on someone else's platform, the rug can be pulled out from under you at any moment. If your business is in content creation, the unfortunate reality is that due to [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) can't be ignored, and so that usually means building at least some of your business on someone else's platform is unavoidable. The key is to understand that this isn't ideal and design the rest of your business around mediating its impact. If it's necessary to share your content on a platform, because that's where the audience is, you should still also always have your own URL where people can find your content and follow you. And most importantly, *don't use someone else's platform that you have no control over unless you have to*.
