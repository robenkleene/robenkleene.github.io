The website for my own app coming soon, [Repla](https://repla.app/), has been updated. The first version of Repla focuses on "Repla Server": A better way to run local web apps so that they always refresh. My history with this problem dates back to when I was a web designer and frontend developer, it used to drive me crazy switching back and forth between my editor and browser just to hit the refresh key.

Repla Server solves this problem perfectly. I'm using it right now to preview the draft of this post in the local version of this blog running Jekyll. I can make an edit in BBEdit on the left, and Repla automatically refreshes on the right.
