[Alex Molina interviews Adam Lisagor, Zach Hobesh, and Jeff Hodges](http://www.microfilmmaker.com/2017/10/redgiant_adamlisagor_interview/) of [Sandwich](https://sandwich.co/), for special effects plug-in maker [Red Giant](https://www.redgiant.com/) (whose plug-ins are used heavily by Sandwich):

> Adam Lisagor: It turns out that post-production and visual effects play a large part of that because, when I started this company seven years ago, people were already accustomed to video being pretty prevalent, but what wasn’t so prevalent was interesting visual effects and interesting digital visualizations done tastefully, in ways that help enhance your understanding of what’s being shown.

This captures something Sandwich do really well in their videos:

> Jeff Hodges: Going along the lines of what Adam was saying about using VFX and graphics to help tell a story and explain things in the Sandwich style, a lot of what we end up doing is integrating our motion graphics into the scenes so they feel like they really belong there.

There's some great information about Sandwich's tools and process, the Red Giant products they call out are [Universe](https://www.redgiant.com/products/universe/), [Magic Bullet Suite](https://www.redgiant.com/products/magic-bullet-suite), and the Keying Suite (now part of the [VFX Suite](https://www.redgiant.com/products/vfx-suite/)).
