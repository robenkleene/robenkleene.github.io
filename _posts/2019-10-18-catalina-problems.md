[Michael Tsai](https://twitter.com/mjtsai) [collected a list of problems](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/10/15/catalina-system-issues/) users are having with [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/). There's also [a list of problems with specific apps](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/10/15/catalina-app-issues/) including [Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html), [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/), and [Little Snitch](https://obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html).

[Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) summarized Catalina best on [a recent episode of the Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/episodes/347): This release solves a bunch of problems for Apple, [tightening up the security model](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/23/annoying-catalina-security-features/) and removing [old software](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/04/11/2012-apples-great-gpl-purge/) they no longer want to support, but it doesn't solve very many problems for users.
