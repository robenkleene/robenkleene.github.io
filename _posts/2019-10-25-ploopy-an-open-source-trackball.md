title: "Ploopy: An Open Source Trackball"

[Ploopy](https://www.ploopy.co/) is an open source trackball based on the venerable [Microsoft Trackball Explorer](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-D68-00007-Trackball-Explorer/dp/B00005853Z)---which is no longer in production but is popular enough demand a hefty price in the secondhand market. Ploopy is available to [pre-order in kit form](https://www.ploopy.co/s/shop). I prefer trackpads these days, because the [gestures for accessing Mission Control and App Expos√©](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204895) are too good to pass up, but before that I preferred trackballs to mice. I went from the Microsoft Trackball Explorer itself through [every generation of the Kensington Expert Mouse](http://xahlee.info/kbd/kensington_expert_mouse_hist.html)---the most recent of which is [still available new today](https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Expert-Trackball-Mouse-K64325/dp/B00009KH63/).

I also use an [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard, and part of the appeal is the [open source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware). I'm hoping to be able to use this keyboard design for the rest of my career. But I'm not sure the open source hardware model works as well for a pointing device. One of the reasons it works so well for keyboards is that the foundational technology has changed to little over the years. [Cherry MX](https://www.cherrymx.de) switches were [developed in the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_\(keyboards\)#Cherry_MX_switches_in_consumer_keyboards) and, as far as I can tell, they're similar to the product that's the industry standard today. Pointing devices on the other hand, gone through a couple of upheavals like the [optical mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse) and [touchpads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad) themselves.
