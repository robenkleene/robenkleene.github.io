[Riccardo Mori](https://twitter.com/morrick) [pens a piece](http://morrick.me/archives/8599) on why he's avoiding updating to [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/):

> What I want from a new version of an operating system, especially one as mature as Mac OS, is that it fixes or improves what was not working well in previous versions, and that it leaves tried-and-true features and functionalities as untouched as technically possible. I don’t need and I don’t want disruption for disruption’s sake on a yearly basis. While I understand that today’s tech motto is The show must go on, that also doesn’t have to mean that the show should get painful to watch.

Here's how I'd summarize Apple's position on macOS: Apple wants to focus their energy on [areas of growth](http://www.asymco.com/2019/09/25/the-triumph-of-the-walled-garden/), and [the Mac isn't growing very much](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/11/q2-2019-pc-shipments/). But Apple recognizes that the Mac has an importance greater than its growth numbers belie (even if it's a begrudgingly recognition). For one, all of the software for iOS is built on the Mac, as is [a disproportionate amount of media content](http://motionographer.com/2016/01/25/2015-hardware-survey-results/) and [software development for other platforms](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-developers-primary-operating-systems) relative to the Mac's marketshare.

These advantages are important enough that Apple wants to keep them[^whyistheipadstillsobadatwork], and in order to do so, they need to make sure the Mac can still run their own pro apps: [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/), [Logic Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). And a small selection of third-party software that would definitely include [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Back to Mori's piece, so what we should expect from Apple is that they'll reduce the flexibility and power of the Mac, since it makes the Mac difficult to maintain, as much as they can while still making sure that those core apps can still run. So if you depend on the Mac for something other than those apps, you're going to be in for a bumpy ride.

[^whyistheipadstillsobadatwork]: It strikes me as incredibly bizarre that Apple would promote the iPad the future ("what's a computer?") when everything they make at the company is built on Macs. Carts can't pull horses; what Apple should be doing is improving the iPad to the point where all of those employees are using iPads for their work *then* starting to pitch it as the future.
