Adobe has released [Lightroom 3](http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/2019/11/adobe-announces-lightroom-v3-0-10-2019.html) and [Lightroom Classic 9](http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/2019/11/updates-to-lightroom-classic-v9.html). The banner feature for both versions is the same: When creating a panorama by merging photos, there's a new "Fill Edges" option that uses [content-aware fill](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/content-aware-fill.html) to even out the edges. Other features are different between versions, with Lightroom 3 focusing on built-in tutorials[^lightroomtutorials] while Lightroom 9 focuses on new organizational features and performance improvements.

Lightroom 3 is the same version that's [available in the app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom/id1451544217?mt=12), while Lightroom Classic is [only available directly from Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html). You can find many [comparisons between the two](https://www.lightroomqueen.com/lightroom-cc-vs-classic-features/), but my quick summary is that Lightroom hosts all of your images in the cloud, no matter what[^nophotoshoots], while  Lightroom Classic hosts all your files on your hard drive. Lightroom Classic can sync photos to [Adobe's Creative Cloud](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/lightroom-mobile-desktop-features.html), but this only syncs the ["Smart Previews"](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/lightroom-smart-previews.html), not the original [raw images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format). The second difference between the two versions is features, only Lightroom Classic [supports plugins](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/plug-ins.html), and Lightroom doesn't have the insanely useful [snapshots and history features](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/how-to/lightroom-snapshots-history.html).

[^lightroomtutorials]: I've played around with Lightroom's built-in tutorials, but the technology only plays nicely with sliders affecting the whole image, and not more specialized tools like [brushes](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/how-to/brighten-up-a-face.html) and the [guided upright](http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/2016/06/adobe-announces-guided-upright-in-lightroom-cc.html). This limits their usefulness because the sliders aren't exactly difficult to use.

[^nophotoshoots]: Hosting all of the images in the cloud is more problematic than it at first appears. For example it means if you're doing a large photoshoot, you have to upload the whole thing to work with it in Lightroom (and pay Adobe for [cloud storage space](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/store-manage-photos.html)).
