a [presentation for Avid's Q3 2019 earnings call](http://ir.avid.com/static-files/24d44f2e-380a-45a3-ba0c-28f91593a2d9). Avid reported over 170,000 subscribers total across [Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer-first), [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools), and [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius). They didn't report numbers for individual products, but they did include a color-coded bar graph that I measured and got the following numbers[^gollnersnumbersweredifferent]:

- [**Sibelius**](https://www.avid.com/sibelius): ~32,000
- [**Media Composer**](https://www.avid.com/media-composer-first): ~36,000
- [**Pro Tools**](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools): ~102,000

For comparison, as of 2017 [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) had [over two million users](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/26/final-cut-pro-x-sales/), and in 2015 [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) had [over 6 million subscribers](https://www.studiodaily.com/2015/12/adobe-posts-record-subscriber-growth-creative-cloud/). Avid products are popular in Hollywood for cutting TV and movies. In fact, as [Avid reported in a press release](http://ir.avid.com/news-releases/news-release-details/update-avid-customers-shine-91st-annual-academy-awards) earlier this year, Avid's tools were used by *every single nominee* in some of the most important [Academy Awards](https://oscar.go.com/) categories:

> Every nominee and award winner in the best picture, sound mixing, sound editing and film editing categories relied on Avid creative tools.

As to why Avid is so popular in Hollywood, previously Gollner [made notes](http://alex4d.com/notes/item/why-avid-is-no-1-in-hollywood) on [a podcast interview](https://digitalcinemacafe.com/2014/08/22/fcg074-avid-in-tv-feat-austin-flack/) by [Chris Fenwick](https://twitter.com/chrisfenwick) with TV editor [Austin Flack](https://twitter.com/austinflack). The overwhelming emphasis is on collaboration features.
