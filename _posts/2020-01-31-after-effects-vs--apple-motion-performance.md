[Simon Ubsdell sets up the same project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa3iXgkF8g) in [Apple's Motion](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/motion/) and [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html). In Motion he's able to make edits at a full 24 FPS, the final frame rate, while in After Effects the frame rates drops down to 3 FPS while making changes.

This kind of comparison has been done before with [Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tAtbtQxA2I) with similar results (Final Cut renders video at well over twice the speed of Premiere), but I've never seen it done with Motion and After Effects. I don't think there are nearly as many people who know both of the motion graphics programs, relative to the video editors, in particular Motion doesn't even show up when [polling motion graphics professionals](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2019/09/21/motion-graphics-software-market-share/).
