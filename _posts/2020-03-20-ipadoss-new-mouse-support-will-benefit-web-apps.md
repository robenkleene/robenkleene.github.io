A huge beneficiary of [iPadOS's new mouse support](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/03/19/craig-federighi-demos-the-ipads-new-trackpad/) will be web apps, because, with [App Sandboxing](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/), those are the only desktop apps that can run in their full versions on iPadOS.

Take [Figma's plugin system](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/) for example, even if [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) had an iPadOS app, this type of functionality wouldn't be possible because [App Store Review Guideline 2.5.2](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#2.5.2) forbids native apps from being extensible[^extensibilityisimportant]. People are already tweeting about how well the new mouse support works for [Figma](https://twitter.com/timothyachumba/status/1240563792695693312), [Webflow](https://twitter.com/moritz_design/status/1240398165485985797), and [Visual Studio Code](https://twitter.com/gbougakov/status/1241024611204001794) (in the browser via [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)).
