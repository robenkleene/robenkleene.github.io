The [Omni Group's 2020 roadmap](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2020) has [a great section on automation](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2020#automation) that's worth reading in its entirety. It covers both their future plans for their own apps, and a declaration of why automation is important in general:

> By providing automation technology in our apps, we make it possible for customers to extend our apps’ capabilities. People can build customized solutions to meet their own needs—and then share those solutions with others. We had thousands of customers using Kinkless GTD in OmniOutliner, even though most of those customers didn’t know AppleScript. I’ve been told that one of JTech Communications’ most popular blog posts was for a script for OmniGraffle which counts items on a canvas. With automation, people are able to create their own keyboard shortcuts to quickly perform actions like creating a task calendar from OmniFocus, or exporting Markdown from OmniOutliner—and those solutions can often be shared with others, making everyone’s lives easier.

The Omni Group is apparently [going through some hard times](https://inessential.com/2020/03/31/looking_for_work), bless them for taking automation so seriously in their apps.
