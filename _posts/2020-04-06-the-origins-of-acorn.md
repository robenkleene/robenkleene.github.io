[Gus Mueller](https://twitter.com/ccgus) of [Flying Meat Software](https://flyingmeat.com/) on [how the image editor Acorn emerged organically](https://shapeof.com/archives/2019/11/profile_of_myself_on_the_app_store.html) from working on his annotation tool, [FlySketch](https://flyingmeat.com/flysketch/):

> Acorn grew out of upgrades to another app of mine, FlySketch, designed for screen capture and sketching. Customers asked for new features, I started adding brushes and layers and multiple windows, and all of a sudden I had a full-blown image editor. But Acorn still serves different needs than professional-level editors. Acorn is powerful, but nimble and approachable. It also has excellent documentation that weâ€™ve worked hard on for years.
