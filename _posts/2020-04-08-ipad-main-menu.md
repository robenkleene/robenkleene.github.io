[Alexander Käßner](https://twitter.com/alexkaessner/) presents his [iPad Main Menu](https://ipadmenu.study/) concept. The menu concept itself is great, but what I'm really blown away by the presentation, which is agency quality but was presumably created by one person. Käßner [explained on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexkaessner/status/1247586881061228545) that he created the [demo video](https://vimeo.com/404389115) with [Drama](https://drama.app/), [Rotato](https://www.rotato.xyz/), and [Motion](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/motion/).
