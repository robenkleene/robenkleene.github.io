[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is arguably the most influential text editor ever made. Among the numerous features it popularized are:

1. [Abbreviation-Based Snippets](https://macromates.com/manual/en/snippets)
2. [Auto-Paired Characters](https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_text#auto-paired_characters_quotes_etc)
3. [Fuzzy-Finding by Filename](https://macromates.com/manual/en/working_with_multiple_files#moving_between_files_with_grace).

These features have all since been built-in to every subsequent popular text editor. In addition, the [scope selectors](https://macromates.com/manual/en/scope_selectors) and [theming](https://macromates.com/manual/en/themes) implementation that TextMate pioneered form the basis of themes, syntax highlighting, and scoping language-specific functionality in every subsequent popular text editor.

That's already an impressive list of features to all stem from a single app, especially one that entered an already mature category, and we haven't even gotten to TextMate's greatest influence: TextMate was the first popular text editor to be built around [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29). It's this change that would entirely re-shaped text editor market forever, solidify the niche status of every text editor that came before it, and pave the way for the eventual dominance of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), more than a decade later. Based on how subsequent text editors have all been built around TextMate's use of extensions, it's fair to call [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and VS Code, "TextMate-likes".
