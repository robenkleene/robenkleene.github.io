I'm Roben Kleene, currently an iOS Engineering Manager at the [Wall Street Journal](https://wsj.com/mobile). Software is both my work and a hobby, for better or worse. I love Mac and iOS GUI apps, and Unix command line utilities, increasingly I prefer the latter, but anything I also want to do on my phone---which is almost everything---will always be the former.

I host my public code on [GitHub](https://github.com/robenkleene). I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robenkleene), [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:robenkleene), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/robenkleene/). You can [email me](mailto:contact@robenkleene.com) directly. I have some older work at [1percenter.com](http://1percenter.com), that I keep around as a time capsule in case skeuomorphism makes a comeback.

My other hobby is synthesis and electronic instruments. I sometimes end up [making](https://github.com/robenkleene/euclidean-sequencer "Euclidean Sequencer") [tools](https://github.com/robenkleene/thwomp "Thwomp") in this space. No matter what I do, I end up making or using software for it.
