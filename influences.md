* [Blue Note Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note): [One][Dialogue], [Two][Lunch], [Three][Departure], [Four][Unity]
* [Giegling](https://www.giegling.net/): "The label's elegant sleeve designs came from two longtime friends of the family: Schaarly and later Christoph Laurisch. 'For the STAUB series, it's real dust on the covers,' says Dustin, referring to a series of Giegling records linked to the 2012 Mayan apocalypse. 'The dust that we used on the first sleeve came from the parties in the house.' A whimsical look falls across his face. 'Memories!'"---[Will Lynch](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2292)
* [Kompakt](https://kompakt.fm/)
* [Ricardo Villalobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Villalobos): "When I arrived, it was impossible to tell who was playing, given that the DJ was placed at floor level behind a heaving crowd. (Extra points to the venue: a "VIP" area behind the turntables, unprotected by ropes or guards; clubs are best when access is universal.) When I asked a dancer next to me who was playing, he only grinned and slurred, "I don't know, *and I don't fucking care*." Fair enough: the music was deep, immersive and composed of long mixes whose beginnings and ends were deliciously blurred, an undulating sequence of beats without measure or end. It had to be Villalobos. And yes, craning closer, it was."---[Philip Sherburne](https://pitchfork.com/features/techno/6785-techno/)
